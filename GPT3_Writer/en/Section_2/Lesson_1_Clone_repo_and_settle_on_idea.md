Let’s build something!

I’ve already shown you a ton of use cases and types of prompts. What you’ve probably noticed is that GPT-3 kinda sucks as a “general assistant” but it’s really fkin good once you come up with a really good prompt for a specific task. Ex: writing tweets, generating startup ideas, creating lyrics to a song, etc.

A good prompt can take you 15-20m to come up with. **But, once you come up with that prompt you can just keep on using it for 1000s of cases.** That’s what I want you to remember.

For example, I figured out that this prompt generates decent landing page headlines:

```
Write a list of short landing page headlines in the style of Apple for a startup that builds the following:
```

From here, I could create a website that help **anyone** generate landing page headlines! All they’d need to do would be to give me a description of their startup and then I’d plug it into the prompt here.

What’s sick about OpenAI is that this can be done via the API so you can create really custom, specialized tools powered by GPT-3 + the magical prompts your discover.

So like I showed you way back at the beginning of this build, we’re going to build two things:

- First, a **web app** that lets anyone come and use GPT-3 for a specialized purpose you come up with (ex. writing a movie script, coming up with ad copy, generating a love letter, whatever you want).
- Second, a **Chrome Extension** that lets people use your GPT-3 prompts on any website they want (ex. generate tweets right in Twitter, generate a cool post right in LinkedIn, generate landing page copy for the headline right into Webflow, etc).

### Clone the repo.

If you don’t have an idea of your web app/chrome extension’s “specialized purpose” yet — don’t worry! One step at a time. Let’s get the base project working first.

We’ve created a project with a basic React/NextJS project + some CSS to keep you moving fast. Go ahead and fork the project [here](https://github.com/buildspace/gpt3-writer-starter).

To do so, just click “**Fork**” at the top and then clone the forked repo. This will fork the repo into your personal account which will make it easier to push code/deploy our project later.

Also, drop a star on it as well if you’re feeling nice!

Once you’ve forked the repo, go ahead and clone it, your clone URL will be specific to you. It should look like this:

```
https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME_HERE/gpt3-writer-starter.git
```

And from there, we’re ready to go. `cd` into the project, install `next`, `react`, and `react-dom` and then run `yarn` to get the project going.

```

# cd into the repo
cd gpt3-writer-starter

# install next if you don't have it
yarn add next react react-dom

# run it
yarn dev
```

Then, head to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should see the following:

**A note for those who are pretty familiar with React** — Feel free to speed run this part of the build.

**A note for those ***not that familiar*** with React** — You don’t need to be a React expert to do this. If there are some things you don’t understand as you go through this, just Google them and power through.

### Add a textbox + generate button.

So remember — our goal is to create a website where users can come on, type some stuff, and then have some text generated by GPT-3 for some specific purpose (ex. generate metal song titles, generate speeches in the tone of Obama, whatever).

Don’t worry about changing your headline or your subtitle just yet. Leave them as is for now. We’ll get there!

First thing we want to do is add a place where users can type stuff! So, we’re going to add a `textarea`. Go ahead and add it with the following code below in `index.js`, again — I added some CSS to help you out and make sure things look decent.

```jsx
const Home = () => {
  return (
    <div className="root">
      <div className="container">
        <div className="header">
          <div className="header-title">
            <h1>sup, insert your headline here</h1>
          </div>
          <div className="header-subtitle">
            <h2>insert your subtitle here</h2>
          </div>
        </div>
        {/* Add this code here*/}
        <div className="prompt-container">
          <textarea placeholder="start typing here" className="prompt-box" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="badge-container grow">
        <a
          href="https://buildspace.so/builds/ai-writer"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"
        >
          <div className="badge">
            <Image src={buildspaceLogo} alt="buildspace logo" />
            <p>build with buildspace</p>
          </div>
        </a>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;

```

*Note: whenever I change code I’ll add a little comment above the part I changed/added to keep it easy for you. Ex. above I added the `{/* Add this code here*/}` comment above the div I added for the `textarea`.*

Once you’ve done that, you’ll have something that looks like this. Try typing in it as well to make sure it’s working as planned.

`textarea` is pretty cool because it gives us a simple way to let users type on our web app *and* it gives us an easy way to actually capture what the user is typing **so we can send it to the GPT-3 API later.

Let’s set up that capture system so we know what our user is typing. We’re going to add a [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) for this —  go ahead and import `useState` at the top off your file:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
```

From there, we’re going to create two new state variables: `userInput` and `setUserInput` which we’ll use in a moment. Go ahead and add this line right underneath `const Home = () => {`.

```jsx
const [userInput, setUserInput] = useState('');
```

Now, let’s put those variables to use on the `textarea` you created earlier.

```jsx
<textarea
  className="prompt-box"
  placeholder="start typing here"
  value={userInput}
  onChange={onUserChangedText}
/>;
```

*Note: Your code will be crashing here because we haven’t created the `onUserChangedText` function yet.*

What are we doing here? Well, first, we set the `value` of the `textarea` to `userInput` which means that whatever is in the `userInput` variable we’re going to show in the `textarea`.

Then we have an `onChange` parameter — so, whenever the user types, it’ll call `onUserChangedText`. Let’s go ahead and write that function. It’s pretty simple. Add this underneath where you have `const [userInput  , setUserInput]`:

```jsx
const onUserChangedText = (event) => {
  console.log(event.target.value);
  setUserInput(event.target.value);
};
```

All this does is call `setUserInput` and sets it to whatever is in the `textarea`. This way, the value of `userInput` will always be updated with whatever is in the `textarea`.

Easy! Let’s test it. Head to your console and start typing in your `textarea` to make sure you’re capturing the input properly:

![Untitled](https://i.imgur.com/X6cS8xx.png)

See how it drops an event for every key you type in? We’re taking that event object, grabbing the text, printing it, and then holding it in our input state. Feel free to remove the `console.log` statement now so it doesn’t clutter up your console.

Now, we just want to add a generate button that our user can click to generate some magic — later we’ll connect this to the GPT-3 API. But for now, we’ll just add it in as a button that doesn’t do anything.

```jsx
<div className="prompt-container">
  <textarea
    placeholder="start typing here"
    className="prompt-box"
    value={userInput}
    onChange={onUserChangedText}
  />
  {/* New code I added here */}
  <div className="prompt-buttons">
    <a className="generate-button" onClick={null}>
      <div className="generate">
        <p>Generate</p>
      </div>
    </a>
  </div>
</div>
```

I gave it an `onClick={null}` for now, later we’ll write a function to connect it to the GPT-3 API.

Sick, your app should look spicy now, nearly all our UI is in place.

### Settle on your headline + subtitle.

At this point, you got a pretty clean-looking web app that lets people input some text that we’ll later send to GPT-3. Hell yea.

So, now before we add in GPT-3 we have to do something really important, we need to settle on a headline + subtitle.

Imagine a random person hits your GPT-3 writer, **what do you want them to do?**

Again, just using GPT-3 as a general assistant kinda sucks + we can just use Playground for that. It helps to decide on the specific thing you want this thing to do.

*You can change this later of course*, but it helps to have at least something that you think is kinda cool before we move on.

Here are some examples:

- **Headline**: Generate a tweet thread about crypto. **Subtitle**: Write a quick sentence about what you want the tweet thread to be about (ex. Ethereum and it’s price, Solana and it’s transaction speed, Bitcoin and it’s longevity).
- **Headline**: Have Donald Trump explain stuff to you. **Subtitle:** Write a topic that you want Donald Trump to explain to you (ex. nuclear fission, how airplanes work, the meaning of life).
- **Headline:** Talk to Goku from Dragon Ball Z **Subtitle:** Write a message to Goku, ask him about anything (ex. what’s the meaning of life, how did you get so strong, etc).

It’s just like a landing page! The headline is short and sweet. And, the subtitle explains a bit more.

Also, notice how specific each of these are! The more specific the use case, the better GPT-3 will perform after all. There are sooooooo many use cases — GPT-3 can do everything from generate code to write amazing text messages to reply to your Tinder date. Get creative. Have fun with it.

Once you come up with your headline + subtitle, change it in the code!

```
<div className="header-title">
  <h1>sup, insert your headline here</h1>
</div>
<div className="header-subtitle">
  <h2>insert your subtitle here</h2>
</div>
```

For my web app, I’m going to build something pretty simple — a tool that generates blog posts, but my special touch is that the blog posts all have the tone of Paul Graham because I really like his clear and concise style.

I learn **a lot** from blog posts — but, it’s really hard to find good ones usually. Especially around topics that aren’t as popular.

For example, the other day I was Googling around about nuclear fission but all the posts were either extremely technical or super simple. Also, I hated the writing style of most of them.

I wanna generate really good ones myself to learn from! Plus, I could even use the generated ones on my own blog as well so they’re helpful to others.

Let’s go!

Please **don’t copy** any of my headlines here — come up with your own specific use-case. Add your own spin to this thing. Otherwise, it won’t be fun I promise.

### Please do this or Farza will be sad.

Go ahead and take a screenshot of your GPT-3 writer with your fancy new headline and subtitle. Share it in #progress to inspire others who are searching for cool use cases.
