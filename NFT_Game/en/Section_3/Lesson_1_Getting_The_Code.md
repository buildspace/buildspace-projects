We'll be using this thing called [Replit](https://replit.com/~)!

It is a browser-based IDE that lets us easily build web apps and deploy them all from the browser. It is super legit. Instead of having to set up a full local environment and write commands to deploy, it's all just given to us.

Note: **You don't have to use replit to build + deploy your site. If you want to work locally on VSCode and use Vercel/Heroku/AWS to deploy and are confident in your web dev skills -- that's totally cool. [Here is a link](https://github.com/buildspace/buildspace-nft-game-starter) to the base repo you can clone and work on locally.**

Make an account on Replit before moving on.

I've already created a basic react project that you can **fork** on Replit. **[Just click here](https://replit.com/@adilanchian/nft-game-starter-project?v=1), and near the right you'll see the "Fork" button.** Be sure you're logged in, then click this.

You'll magically clone my repo and full IDE in your browser to work with the code. Once it stops loading and shows you some code click "run" at the top and you're good to go. Might take 2-4 min the first time.

Here's a quick video I made for a different project going over some Replit basics:
