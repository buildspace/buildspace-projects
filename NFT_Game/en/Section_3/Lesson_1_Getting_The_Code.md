### 🏁 Getting started with React.js
Now this is where the fun **REALLY** starts. Writing and deploying your smart contract is one thing, but building a portal where anyone in the world can interact with the blockchain is just pure magic ✨.

We are going to be using **react.js** to build our web app. If you are already familiar with React, this will be a breeze. If you haven't done much React, don't worry! You can still make it through this project, but it may feel a bit more difficult. Don't give up! The more you struggle the more you learn 🧠.

If you have no experiece w/ React - [checkout this intro series](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) before you get started with this section or at least check out the intro docs [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html). Or don't do anything special, just hop in. Whatever works for you :). You'll be an absolute React Wizard after this project if you aren't already 🧙‍♂!

### ⬇️ Getting the code
We'll be using this thing called [Replit](https://replit.com/~)!

It is a browser-based IDE that lets us easily build web apps and deploy them all from the browser. It is super legit. Instead of having to set up a full local environment and write commands to deploy, it's all just given to us.

Note: **You don't have to use replit to build + deploy your site. If you want to work locally on VSCode and use Vercel/Heroku/AWS to deploy and are confident in your web dev skills -- that's totally cool. [Here is a link](https://github.com/buildspace/buildspace-nft-game-starter) to the base repo you can clone and work on locally.**

Make an account on Replit before moving on.

I've already created a basic react project that you can **fork** on Replit. **[Just click here](https://replit.com/@adilanchian/nft-game-starter-project?v=1), and near the right you'll see the "Fork" button.** Be sure you're logged in, then click this.

You'll magically clone my repo and full IDE in your browser to work with the code. Once it stops loading and shows you some code click "run" at the top and you're good to go. Might take 2-4 min the first time.

**Please Note: As you go through this project, you may notice that we are referencing `.js` files. In Replit, if you are creating any new JavaScript files, you will need to use the `.jsx` extension instead! Replit has some performance fanciness that requires you use the `.jsx` file extension :).**

Here's a quick video I made for a different project going over some Replit basics:
