The cool part about our game? We mint actual NFTs that are used to play and all the game logic happens on-chain. Earlier in this project, we set up all of our smart contract logic. Now it's time to actually interact with it.

### 🌊 The flow.

The first thing we are going to start with is to check whether the wallet address connected to our app has a character NFT already. If it does, we can go ahead and grab the metadata from the wallet's NFT and use it to battle a boss in the metaverse ⚔️.

Here's the flow of getting our web app connected to our deployed smart contract on the Rinkeby Testnet:

1. Copy latest deployed contract address, paste it in to our web app.
2. Copy the latest ABI file, paste it into our web app's directory. (Later, we will delve more into what an ABI is).
3. Import [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js) to help us talk to our smart contract from the client.
4. Call a function on our contract to make it do something!

Pretty straight forward, right? Let's dive in!

### 🏠 Get the latest Smart Contract Address.

Plain and simple, this is the deployed address of your smart contract. Recall how every time you run your `deploy.js` script, your console prints out the address of where your contract lives? We need that address to connect our UI to our smart contract. The blockchain has millions of contracts on it. Our client needs this address to know which contract to connect to.

We are going to be using this address in multiple components, so, let's make it ezpz to get to! At the root of your project under `src` go ahead and create a `constants.js` file and add the following code:

```javascript
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_GOES_HERE';

export { CONTRACT_ADDRESS };
```

Then head back to your `App.js` file and import this at the top of your file to get access to it, like so:

```javascript
import { CONTRACT_ADDRESS } from './constants';
```

### 📁 Get the latest ABI file.

**I made a little video below explaining ABI stuff.**

[Loom](https://www.loom.com/share/2d493d687e5e4172ba9d47eeede64a37)

**Please give it a watch as I go over some important stuff (note this video shows this process happening in another project. Don't worry - it's the same exact flow)**

When you compile your smart contract, the compiler spits out a bunch of files that let you interact with the contract. You can find these files in the `artifacts` folder located in the root of your Solidity project.

Our web app relies on the ABI file to know how to communicate with our contract. Read more about it [here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.3/abi-spec.html).

The contents of the ABI file can be found in a fancy JSON file in your hardhat project:

`artifacts/contracts/MyEpicGame.sol/MyEpicGame.json`

So, the question becomes - how do we get this JSON file into our frontend? The good 'ol copy / paste method!

Copy the contents from your `MyEpicGame.json` file and then head to your web app. You are going to make a new folder called `utils` under `src`. Under `utils` create a file named `MyEpicGame.json`. So the full path will look like: `src/utils/MyEpicGame.json`

Paste the ABI file contents right there in our new file.

**SWEET**. Now that we have our file set up, we need to import it into our `App.js` file to utilize it! Simply add this to the top of your imports:

```javascript
import myEpicGame from './utils/MyEpicGame.json';
```

**Note: You may need to Stop and then Start your Replit after adding this file**. Sometimes it doesn't catch the new file!

We now have the two things needed to call our contract from web app: **the ABI file and the deployed contract address!** 

### 🧐 **Some notes on updating your Smart Contract.**

Deployed contracts are permanent. You can't change them. The only way to update a contract is to actually re-deploy it. 

Let's say you wanted to randomly change your contract right now. Here's what we'd need to do:

1. Deploy it again.

2. Update the contract address on our frontend (copy/paste from console log).

3. Update the abi file on our frontend (copy/paste from `artifacts` folder).

**People constantly forget to do these 3 steps when they change their contract. Don't forget lol.**

Why do we need to do all this? Because smart contracts are **immutable.** They can't change. They're permanent. That means changing a contract requires a full redeploy. Redeploying will also **reset** all the variables since it'd be treated as a brand new contract. **That means we lose all our NFT data when we update the contract's code.**

So, what you'll need to do is:

1. Deploy again using `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby`

2. Change `contractAddress` in `constants.js` to be the new contract address we got from the step above in the terminal (just like we did before the first time we deployed).

3. Get the updated abi file from `artifacts` and copy-paste it into your web app just like we did above.

**Again -- you need to do this every time you change your contract's code or else you'll get errors :).**

### 📞 Calling the Smart Contract with ethers.js.

Now that we have everything we need, we can set up an object in JavaScript to interact with our smart contract. This is where [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js)  comes in handy!

Import ethers into your `App.js` file:

```javascript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
```

### 🌐 Check your Network! 

At this point it's really important to make sure you are connected to the Rinkeby test network with Metamask! If not, you will be trying to use functions on the smart contract that don't exist on the other networks, and it could cause errors in React like "Unhandled Rejection (Error): call revert exception." Something you can add to your React code to keep things straight is a function that lets you know if you're on the wrong network! Try putting this function in your useEffect: 

```javascript
const checkNetwork = async () => {
  try { 
    if (window.ethereum.networkVersion !== '4') {
      alert("Please connect to Rinkeby!")
    }
  } catch(error) {
    console.log(error)
  }
}
```

Here's a quick breakdown of what we're doing here. Similar to how we normally define ```const { ethereum } = window``` we are using ```networkVersion``` in that ethereum object to check which ethereum network we're on. The ethereum networks have different chain ID's, and the Rinkeby chain ID is "4". All we have to do is say "if the current ethereum network is not Rinkeby, alert the user!" Now anytime the page is not loaded on the Rinkeby you will get a notice for your users to switch to Rinkeby! 

### Recap 

We have done a lot, so let's make sure we are on the same page here - 

Our goal is to call our contract to check if the current wallet address has minted a character NFT. If it has, we can move the player right to the ⚔️ Arena. ⚔️ **ELSE**, *we need them to mint a character NFT before they can play!*

Remember when we created the `checkIfUserHasNFT` in our smart contract?

If the player minted an NFT, that method will return the character NFT metadata. Else, it will return a blank `CharacterAttributes` struct. So - when do we actually want to call this? 

If we think back to scenario #2:

**If user has connected to your app AND does not have a character NFT, show `SelectCharacter` component**

This means we should probably check this as soon as our app loads, right? Let's set up another `useEffect` to do a little fanciness here 💅:

```javascript
/*
 * Add this useEffect right under the other useEffect where you are calling checkIfWalletIsConnected
 */
useEffect(() => {
  /*
   * The function we will call that interacts with out smart contract
   */
  const fetchNFTMetadata = async () => {
    console.log('Checking for Character NFT on address:', currentAccount);

    const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
    const signer = provider.getSigner();
    const gameContract = new ethers.Contract(
      CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      myEpicGame.abi,
      signer
    );

    const txn = await gameContract.checkIfUserHasNFT();
    if (txn.name) {
      console.log('User has character NFT');
      setCharacterNFT(transformCharacterData(txn));
    } else {
      console.log('No character NFT found');
    }
  };

  /*
   * We only want to run this, if we have a connected wallet
   */
  if (currentAccount) {
    console.log('CurrentAccount:', currentAccount);
    fetchNFTMetadata();
  }
}, [currentAccount]);
```

This is some of that fancy React I was talking about before. You will probably also have an error saying how `transformCharacterData` is undefined :(. Keep going - we will address it all shortly: 

Lets go over the stuff we wrote above!

```javascript
const fetchNFTMetadata = async () => {
  console.log('Checking for Character NFT on address:', currentAccount);

  const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
  const signer = provider.getSigner();
  const gameContract = new ethers.Contract(
    CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    myEpicGame.abi,
    signer
  );

  const txn = await gameContract.checkIfUserHasNFT();
  if (txn.name) {
    console.log('User has character NFT');
    setCharacterNFT(transformCharacterData(txn));
  } else {
    console.log('No character NFT found');
  }
};
```

We are declaring the function to run inside our hook. Looks sort of weird, right? But we have to do this because `useEffect` + async don't play well together. By declaring our async function like this, we can get around that. (This is definitely a more difficult thing to understand, so take a look on Google if you are still a little confused.)

```javascript
const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
const signer = provider.getSigner();
```

This is the main logic used to setup our Ethers object and actually call our contract 🚀.  A "Provider" is what we use to actually talk to Ethereum nodes. Remember how we were using Alchemy to **deploy**? Well, in this case, we use nodes that MetaMask provides in the background to send/receive data from our deployed contract. 

We won't get too much into signers, but [here is a link](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/#signers) explaining what a signer is!

```javascript
const gameContract = new ethers.Contract(
  CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  myEpicGame.abi,
  signer
);

const txn = await gameContract.checkIfUserHasNFT();
```

After we create our provider and signer, we are ready to create our contract object! This line is what actually creates the connection to our contract. It needs: the contract's address, ABI file, and a signer. These are the three things we always need to communicate with contracts on the blockchain.

With this all set up, we can then finally call the `checkIfUserHasNFT` method. Again, this is going to go to our contract on the blockchain and run a read request and return some data for us.  **Can we pause and realize how insanely cool that is?** You're a straight up blockchain developer right now 🔥.

Feel free to `console.log(txn)` and see what's in it!

```javascript
if (txn.name) {
  console.log('User has character NFT');
  setCharacterNFT(transformCharacterData(txn));
} else {
  console.log('No character NFT found!');
}
```

Once we get a response from our contract, we need to check if there is indeed a minted character NFT. We are going to do this by checking if there is a name. If there is a name for the character NFT then we know this person already has one!

With that, let's set our `characterNFT` state with this data so we can use it in our app! 

It's now time to address that `transformCharacterData` method we are calling. Since we will be getting character data in other spots in our app, why would we want to write the some code over and over again? Let's get a little fancy with it 😎. 

We can get rid of the undefined error by heading to the `constants.js` file that we created to hold our contract address and add the following:

```javascript
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_GOES_HERE';

/*
 * Add this method and make sure to export it on the bottom!
 */
const transformCharacterData = (characterData) => {
  return {
    name: characterData.name,
    imageURI: characterData.imageURI,
    hp: characterData.hp.toNumber(),
    maxHp: characterData.maxHp.toNumber(),
    attackDamage: characterData.attackDamage.toNumber(),
  };
};

export { CONTRACT_ADDRESS, transformCharacterData };
```

This puts the data from our smart contract into a nice object that we can easily use in our UI code! Pretty nifty, eh?

Don't forget to import this back in `App.js` like so:

```javascript
/*
* Just add transformCharacterData!
*/
import { CONTRACT_ADDRESS, transformCharacterData } from './constants';
```

Now, onto the final little bit of code from my snippet above:

```javascript
if (currentAccount) {
  console.log('CurrentAccount:', currentAccount);
  fetchNFTMetadata();
}
```

Remember, we only want to call this function if we have a connected wallet address! We can't do anything if there is no wallet address, right?  Any time this `useEffect` runs, just make sure we actually have a wallet address connected. Else, don't run anything.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
	...
}, [currentAccount]);
```

Alright, so what the heck is this `[currentAccount]` thing? It's the user's public wallet address that we get from Metamask. **Anytime the value of `currentAccount` changes, this `useffect` will get fired**! For example, when `currentAccount` changes from `null` to a new wallet address, this logic will run. 

Do some Googling and [check out this link](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) from React docs to learn more.

### ⭕️ Bringing it full circle.

All the things are in place. You are feeling good and you're an insanely talented engineer. So let's test this, shall we?

Give your app a good 'ol refresh and make sure you don't have a connected wallet just yet. Then, go ahead and connect your wallet. Make sure you open up your console so you can see the log statements come in!

Refresh your page. At this point, you should see your console spit out: `No character NFT found` . Nice! This means that your code is running as it's supposed to and you are ready to start minting some character NFTs 🤘!
