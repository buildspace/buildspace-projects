### 😍 You've done it

Super exciting that you made it to the end. Pretty big deal!!

Be sure to add some of *your own* finishing touches as well :).

Thank you for contributing to the future of web3 by learning this stuff. The fact that you know how this works and how to code it up is a superpower. Use your power wisely ;).

### 🥞 Careers in Web3

I'm constantly seeing people nail their interviews at web3 companies after they do a few buildspace projects.

**People seem to think web3 just needs people who can code smart contracts or write code that interfaces w/ the blockchain. Not true.**

There is so much work to do and most of the work doesn't even have to do w/ smart contracts lol. **Being an engineer in web3 just means you take your web2 skills and apply them to web3.**

I want to quickly go over wtf it means to "work in web3" as an engineer. *Do you need to be a pro at Solidity? Do you need to know how every little thing about the blockchain works?* 

For example, let's say you're a great frontend engineer. If you finished this project, **you have almost everything you need to be a great frontend engineer at a web3 company**. For example, the company may say "Hey — pls go and build our connect to wallet feature" — and you'd already have a solid idea on how to do that :).

I just wanna inspire you to work in web3 lol. This shit is awesome. And it'd be cool if you gave it a shot ;).

Be sure you click "Work in Web3" on the left and fill out your profile if you haven't done so already!!! **We're partnered w/ some of the best web3 companies in the world (ex. OpenSea, Chainlink, Edge and Node, and more) and they want to hire devs from the buildspace network :).** You've already picked up a skill that is actually extremely valuable and companies are paying top dollar for awesome web3 engineers.

### 🤟 Your NFT!

We'll airdrop you your NFT within an hour and will email you once it's in your wallet. It's running on a cron job! If you don't get the email within 24-hours pls pls pls drop us a message in #feedback and tag @ **alec#8853**.

### 🌈 Before you head out

Go to #showcase in Discord and drop us a link to your final product that we can mess around with :).

Also, you should totally tweet out your final project and show the world your epic creation! What you did wasn't easy by any means. Maybe even make a little video showing off your project and attach that to the tweet. Make your tweet look pretty and show off!!

And if you feel up to it, tag @_buildspace :). We'll RT it. **Plus, it gives us a ton of motivation whenever we see people ship their projects.**

Give us that dopamine hit pls.

Lastly, what would also be awesome is if you told us in #feedback how you liked this project and the structure of the project. What did you love most about buildspace? What sucked? What would like us to change for future projects? Your feedback would be awesome!

See yah around!!!
