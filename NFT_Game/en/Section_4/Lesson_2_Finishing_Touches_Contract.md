### üôâ¬†A note on github

**If uploading to Github, don't upload your hardhat config file with your private key to your repo. You will get robbed.**

I use dotenv for this.

```javascript
npm install --save dotenv
```

```javascript
require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle');
require('dotenv').config();

module.exports = {
  solidity: '0.8.0',
  networks: {
    rinkeby: {
      url: process.env.STAGING_QUICKNODE_KEY,
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
    mainnet: {
      chainId: 1,
      url: process.env.PROD_QUICKNODE_KEY,
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
  },
};
```

And your .env file would look something like:

```javascript
STAGING_QUICKNODE_KEY=BLAHBLAH
PROD_QUICKNODE_KEY=BLAHBLAH
PRIVATE_KEY=BLAHBLAH
```

(don't commit your .env after this lol).

### üåé Get your image assets up in IPFS

Right now ‚Äî our boss and character images are on Imgur.

**This isn't good**. If Imgur goes down or shutdown, our awesome characters are all gone and our NFTs are useless!!

Luckily we have something called [IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System) which is essentially a distributed file system Today ‚Äî you might use something like S3 or GCP Storage. But, in this case we can simply trust IPFS which is run by strangers who are using the network. Give [this](https://decrypt.co/resources/how-to-use-ipfs-the-backbone-of-web3) a quick read when you can! Covers a lot of good base knowledge :).

I won't be covering how to get your stuff up on IPFS + connected to your React app step-by-step, but, I will give you some pointers!

First, you'll need to upload your images to a service that specializes in "[pinning](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/pin-files/)" ‚Äî which means your file will essentially be cached so its easily retrievable. I like using [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/?utm_source=buildspace) as my pinning service ‚Äî just make an account, upload your character's image files through their UI, and that's it!

Go ahead and copy the files "CID". This is the files content address on IPFS! What's cool now is we can create this link:

```javascript
https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/INSERT_YOUR_CID_HERE
```

If you are using **Brave Browser** (which has IPFS built in) you can just type this paste into the URL:

```javascript
ipfs://INSERT_YOUR_CID_HERE
```

And that'll actually start an IPFS node on your local machine and retrieve the file! But again, I've only done this on **Brave.** If you try to do it on something like Chrome it just does a Google search lol.

![Untitled](https://i.imgur.com/vQ9Wsr0.png)

From here, you can change your imgur links in `run.js` to `ipfs` hashes! For the sake of example, I used the same CID for all my characters but in your case you would have three different ones, one for each character!

```javascript
const gameContract = await gameContractFactory.deploy(                        
    ["Leo", "Aang", "Pikachu"],       
    ["bafybeibsifcmwkufr7zwh5s3ekvjkfj5nnadjhweniz4p7lxqelt7mbp74", 
    "bafybeibsifcmwkufr7zwh5s3ekvjkfj5nnadjhweniz4p7lxqelt7mbp74", 
    "bafybeibsifcmwkufr7zwh5s3ekvjkfj5nnadjhweniz4p7lxqelt7mbp74"],
    [100, 200, 300],                    
    [100, 50, 25],
    "Elon Musk",
    "https://i.imgur.com/AksR0tt.png",
    10000,
    50
  ); 
```

From here, we just need to update our `tokenURI` function to prepend `ipfs://`. Basically, OpenSea likes when our image URI is structured like this: `ipfs://INSERT_YOUR_CID_HERE`. 

You may be asking why in `run.js` I didn't just directly link to `ipfs://INSERT_YOUR_CID_HERE` or `https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/INSERT_YOUR_CID_HERE`. Basically ‚Äî it's safer to just store the hash itself on the contract, it lets us be a bit more flexible, you'll see :).

So, I change the `json` variable in `tokenURI` to look like this:

```javascript
string memory json = Base64.encode(
      bytes(
        string(
          abi.encodePacked(
            '{"name": "',
            charAttributes.name,
            ' -- NFT #: ',
            Strings.toString(_tokenId),
            '", "description": "An epic NFT", "image": "ipfs://',
            charAttributes.imageURI,
            '", "attributes": [ { "trait_type": "Health Points", "value": ',strHp,', "max_value":',strMaxHp,'}, { "trait_type": "Attack Damage", "value": ',
            strAttackDamage,'} ]}'
          )
        )
      )
    );
```

All I did was prepend that little `ipfs://` after the `image` tag ‚Äî  then I attach the CID! This will basically create our link. Note: It's really easy to mess this up so be careful w/ all the quotation marks! Here's what my metadata looks like now for example:

```javascript
{
	"name": "Pikachu -- NFT #: 1",
	"description": "An epic NFT",
	"image": "ipfs://bafybeibsifcmwkufr7zwh5s3ekvjkfj5nnadjhweniz4p7lxqelt7mbp74",
	"attributes": [{
		"trait_type": "Health Points",
		"value": 300,
		"max_value": 300
	}, {
		"trait_type": "Attack Damage",
		"value": 25
	}]
}
```

Epic, we're off imgur.

Platforms like OpenSea support `ipfs` links so this works out ‚Äî they'll know how to read and render this! We now have a final issue ‚Äî **rendering the image on our React app**!! If we just give our React app something like `ipfs://bafybeibsifcmwkufr7zwh5s3ekvjkfj5nnadjhweniz4p7lxqelt7mbp74` in the `src` tag of the `<img>` tag it won't work! Instead, in your React app, wherever you render the `src` tag of the image, simply do this: 

```javascript
<img src={`https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/${INSERT_THE_CID_YOU_GET_FROM_YOUR_CONTRACT_HERE}`} />
```

Now, you may be asking yourself ‚Äî what is Cloudflare doing here? Basically ‚Äî they're running an IPFS node on our behalf and letting us use it to access files on the network. Technically, you could do this [yourself](https://dev.to/dabit3/uploading-files-to-ipfs-from-a-web-application-50a) as well if you truly wanted to!

**Bam ‚Äî you're now using IPFS :). Wasn't that hard, right!? Tell all your friends. Tell your parents. Tell the world.**


## üê∏ Show all the other players in the game!

Right now, all you see is yourself and the boss -- what if you could see a list of all the other players? Perhaps you could show their wallet address, their character's image, and how much damage they've dealt to the boss!

**Would make it feel a lot more "multiplayer" :).**

Give it a try. Not going to explain it here but I think you have all the info you need to change the contract and the web app to make this happen! All you'll need to do is create a function like `getAllPlayers` and then call that from your web app + render the data nicely!



## ‚ö°Ô∏è Add in critical hit chance

Many games have a cool concept of a "critical hit", like Pokemon! Introducing RNG to games is really fun since it brings in "chance" to the game. It'd be cool if you implemented critical hits -- for example maybe there's a 5% chance that some of your characters hit for double the damage. Or maybe there's a 20% chance the boss's attack "misses" and the player gets away lucky!

It'd be cool if specific characters also had a higher chance of a critical hit than others!

Getting a **true** random number in Solidity is impossible. Feel free to read more on it [here](https://github.com/buildspace/buildspace-projects/blob/main/Solidity_And_Smart_Contracts/en/Section_4/Lesson_1_Randomly_Pick_Winner.md) from a past buildspace project.

This is where Chainlink comes in -- which is an oracle that can give us numbers that are truly random. Here's a guide on implementing it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqZWariqh5s). You can try to implement random numbers without Chainlink first, like how we do [here](https://github.com/buildspace/buildspace-projects/blob/main/Solidity_And_Smart_Contracts/en/Section_4/Lesson_1_Randomly_Pick_Winner.md).
