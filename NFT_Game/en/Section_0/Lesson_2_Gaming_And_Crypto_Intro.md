It's worth briefly talking about why gaming + crypto is so interesting. I feel like when most people talk about this topic they throw out really big numbers like, "Blah game did $1.2 billion in revenue this quarter" or something like that. But, it's more than that! It helps to explain why this stuff is cool. 

For example, Axie Infinity is an NFT-based game that has done **[$2.6 billion dollars](https://dappradar.com/ethereum/games/axie-infinity)** in NFT trades so far. But... what the f does that even mean?! lol.

Why are people losing their minds over things like this?

**Note: this is an "Axie" NFT â€” which is the character you play as in Axie Infinity! Players buy Axie NFTs first, and then go play the game. Pretty weird, right? Buying the characters before you even play the game!**

The buildspace philosophy is to understand by just building it yourself and messing with the tech. But, I would like to go through a quick, informal example ;)!

### ðŸŽ® A quick example w/ Nintendo.

**Let's say you're Nintendo** and you made Super Mario Bros. Mario is now **your** IP. **You're** the creator. No one is allowed to create more games with Mario except **you**. You also want to control who makes % from your characters/universe.

Let's imagine a world instead, where we bring NFTs into the mix.

Let's say Nintendo comes out and says "Hey players! Here are 1,000,000 Mario NFTs. Go buy one for $10. We (Nintendo) are going to be making games that *require* players to own the Mario NFT in their crypto wallet to play them."

For example, players would be able to take their Mario NFT to play as Mario in Super Smash Bros, then maybe they could take their Mario NFT to play Super Mario Galaxy, etc.

The most important thing here is that the Mario NFTs smart contract code would have something special implemented by Nintendo around **royalties**.

For example, players would be able to sell their Mario NFTs on a marketplace.

In this case, Nintendo could say: "every time this NFT sells, we take 10% of whatever it sells for" and they can code that into the NFT contract itself. That means the original creators (Nintendo) can always get in on the profits in a variety of ways that don't require trusting anyone other than the blockchain.

That means as Mario rises in popularity, the NFT needed to play Mario games also rise in value. Nintendo could sell more Mario NFTs as well once the original 1,000,000 are gone. Up to them!

Coolest part? **Players retain a ton of the value.** Players can always hold/sell the original NFTs that would increase in value as the games/characters get more popular. It incentivizes players to help make the game huge as well. Everyone wins :).

**This may sounds crazy but this is pretty much exactly how Axie Infinity works. It's doing billions of dollars in revenue every year.** You can buy some Axie NFTs [here](https://marketplace.axieinfinity.com/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_ybIeMQm0TAMzOvPj1DcoPlIZeWIcL5r4nwefM60mDTM-1634675045-0-gqNtZGzNAjujcnBszQoR) and start playing. As the Axie universe grows more popular, the NFTs increase in value as well!

### ðŸ˜¢ An issue: inflation.

You'll notice the Axies cost like [$300+](https://marketplace.axieinfinity.com/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_ybIeMQm0TAMzOvPj1DcoPlIZeWIcL5r4nwefM60mDTM-1634675045-0-gqNtZGzNAjujcnBszQoR)!!! That's insane and a major turn off for new players. You need three of them to even start playing, so, thats $1K right there.

This is basically caused by inflation in the marketplace. Only a certain # of Axies are being created today but the player base is growing far faster. The result? Crazy prices. There are solutions here that are being explored, but this is definitely a concern when it comes to NFT games. From the official Axie [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/gameplay/axie-population-and-long-term-sustainability):

"*Axie population growth is a major factor within the Axie ecosystem. At any given moment, there exists some ideal inflation rate that allows us to grow to our maximum potential. Too slow and Axie prices are too high for everyday people to join; especially competitive Axies. Too fast and you get unhealthy inflation."*

### ðŸ›  Building open games.

I want to go over another benefit. Easily making games and universes that anyone else can build on via NFTs.

Imagine trying to get a deal with Nintendo to make a game with Mario in it. It would be near impossible unless you were a massive gaming company!! Nintendo would want to do a ton of paperwork detailing how royalties would work.

**But, a cool aspect of NFT games is that anyone would be able to build on top of the Mario NFTs and the original creators can retain value.**

For example, random game devs would be able to make games that required players to **connect their wallet and verify they have the Mario NFT**. If they did, then the game would start and the player's game would be able to access various Mario assets! But, what's in it for Nintendo? Well, as these games made by random devs get more popular it means the original Mario NFTs would rise in value which is good for Nintendo. Let's say you think all this stuff around "selling the NFT" is nonsense.

Well, Nintendo could even code the Mario NFT to say, "every time the Mario NFT is used in a new game, ask player to pay $10 from their Ethereum wallet." 

$5 would go right to Nintendo's wallet. $5 would go right to the dev's wallet.

The possibilities are literally endless because we can program the royalty system to work however we want. 

### ðŸ’ª Lets get to work.

We've been doing a lot of talking. Let's actually build our own little version of an NFT game. By the end, hopefully all this becomes much more concrete and maybe you'll be on your way toward making the next hit NFT game ;).
