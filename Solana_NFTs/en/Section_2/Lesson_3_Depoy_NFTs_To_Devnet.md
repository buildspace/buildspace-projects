This is going to be one of the most epic parts of this project - bringing your candy machine and your NFTs to devnet.

Candy Machine v2 has made this process a lot simpler. With just one command, you'll do the following:

1. Upload your NFTs to [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org) (which is a decentralized file-store) and initialize your candy machine's config. 
2. Create your candy machine on Metaplex's contract.
3. Configure your candy machine with the price, number, go live date, and a bunch of other things.

### ðŸ”‘Â **Setting up a Solana keypair.**

In order to get uploading, we need to set up a local Solana keypair. *Note: If you've done this in the past, still follow the instructions below.*

In order for us to upload the NFTs to Solana, we need to have a "local wallet" to work with in the command line. Remember, you can't talk to Solana unless you have wallet and wallet is basically a "keypair" which is public key and a private key. 

This can be done by running the command below. *Note: When it asks, no need to give it a passphrase, can just press enter and keep it empty.*

```plaintext
solana-keygen new --outfile ~/.config/solana/devnet.json
```

From here, we can set this keypair as our default keypair.

```plaintext
solana config set --keypair ~/.config/solana/devnet.json
```

Now, when we do `solana config get`, you should see `devnet.json` as the `Keypair Path` like below:

```plaintext
Config File: /Users/flynn/.config/solana/cli/config.yml
RPC URL: https://api.devnet.solana.com
WebSocket URL: wss://api.devnet.solana.com/ (computed)
Keypair Path: /Users/flynn/.config/solana/devnet.json
Commitment: confirmed
```

From here you can run

```plaintext
solana balance
```

And it should say `0 SOL`. We can't deploy stuff to Solana without SOL, writing data to the blockchain costs money. In this case, we're on dev net so we can just give ourselves fake SOL. Go ahead and run:

```plaintext
solana airdrop 2
```

After that's done, you can run `solana balance` again and bam you'll have some SOL. *Note: if you ever run out of fake SOL, you can just run this command again.*

### âš™Â **Configure your candy machine**
To tell your candy machine how it should behave, you need to configure it. V2 makes this easy! Create a file called `config.json` in the root folder of your project (the same place as the assets folder) and add the following to it:

```json
{
    "price": 0.1,
    "number": 3,
    "gatekeeper": null,
    "solTreasuryAccount": "<YOUR WALLET ADDRESS>",
    "splTokenAccount": null,
    "splToken": null,
    "goLiveDate": "05 Jan 2021 00:00:00 GMT",
    "endSettings": null,
    "whitelistMintSettings": null,
    "hiddenSettings": null,
    "storage": "arweave",
    "ipfsInfuraProjectId": null,
    "ipfsInfuraSecret": null,
    "awsS3Bucket": null,
    "noRetainAuthority": false,
    "noMutable": false
}
```

This might seem a bit daunting at first, worry not! You only need to know about 5 of these! The rest add extra functionality that you can ignore for now. Let's go over the ones you need to know:

`price`: The price of each NFT. Duh.
`number`: How many NFTs you want to deploy. This needs to match the number of image + json pairs or stuff will break later. 
`solTreasuryAccount`: This is your wallet address, it's where the proceedings from SOL payments will go.
`goLiveDate`: When you want the minting to start. 
`storage`: This is where your NFTs will be stored. 

The only thing you'll need to change here is your wallet address. If you're deploying more than 3 NFTs, update the number! You can deploy up to 10 NFTs on the devnet.  

### ðŸš€Â **Upload the NFTs and create your candy machine**

Now we're going to use Metaplex's `upload` command to upload our NFTs that live in the `assets` folder and create the candy machine. Remember, this will happen all at once. 

Notice how we do `./assets` in the command below. That means we need to run this command from just one level outside of the `assets` folder.

```plaintext
ts-node ~/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-v2-cli.ts upload -e devnet -k ~/.config/solana/devnet.json -cp config.json ./assets
```

*Note: if you get an error like "no such file or directory, scandir './assets'" it means you ran the command from the wrong place. Be sure to run it in the same directory where your `assets` folder is.*

The `upload` command is essentially saying - "Hey Metaplex CLI, take all the NFT pairs in my `assets` folder, upload them to Arweave, initialize the candy machine config holding the pointers to these NFTs, and then save that config on Solana's devnet".

As this command runs, you should see some output in the terminal about what NFT is currently being uploaded.

```plaintext
wallet public key: A1AfJpXEiqiP3twp6CdZCWixpyx6p8E26zej4TNQ12GT
WARNING: The "arweave" storage option will be going away soon. Please migrate to arweave-bundle or arweave-sol for mainnet.

```

See where it says "initialized config for a candy machine" and then spits out a key? You can actually copy/paste that key on Solana's Devnet Explorer [here](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet) to see that it actually deployed to the blockchain. Give it a go! 

Keep this address handy, you'll need it in the future.

You'll notice here if you change your NFTs and run `upload` again, it won't actually upload anything new! The reason for that is there is `.cache` folder created that stores this data.

You will actually need to delete the `.cache` folder and run `upload` again. This will force the initialization of a new candy machine config. Be sure to do this if you want to make changes to your collection before you go live with it!

### âœ…Â **Verify NFTs**

Before moving on, verify your NFTs were actually uploaded by running the `verify` command:

```plaintext
ts-node ~/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-v2-cli.ts verify_upload -e devnet -k ~/.config/solana/devnet.json
```

*Note: You'll notice here we don't tell this command anything about our NFTs. How then does it know what to verify? Well, the `.cache` folder has all the data. If you look inside `devnet-temp.json` you'll see all our data right there.*

Your output should look a bit like this if all went well:

```plaintext
wallet public key: A1AfJpXEiqiP3twp6CdZCWixpyx6p8E26zej4TNQ12GT
Key size 3
uploaded (3) out of (3)
ready to deploy!
```

Boom! You are ready to go! 

If you look at the `devnet-temp.json` file in the `.cache` folder, you'll find 3 Arweave links. Copy + paste one of those Arweave links into your browser and check out your NFT's metadata! Arweave is extremely cool. It stores data **permanently**. This is very different from the world of IPFS/Filecoin â€” where data is store peer-to-peer based on nodes that decide to keep the file around.

Arweave is pay once, store **forever**. They do this using an [algorithm](https://arwiki.wiki/#/en/storage-endowment#toc_Transaction_Pricing) they created that basically estimates the cost needed to store something forever based on how big it is. You can play around with the calculator [here](https://arweavefees.com/). For example, to store 1MB forever it costs `~$0.0083649802618`. Not bad!

You may be asking yourself â€” "well, who's paying to host my stuff then!?". Well if you look through the source code of the script [here](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/blob/59ab126e41e6d85b53c79ad7358964dadd12b5f4/js/packages/cli/src/helpers/upload/arweave.ts#L93), you'll see that Metaplex pays for it themselves for now to help you out!

### ðŸ”¨Â **Update candy machine config.**
To update your candy machine config, all you need to do is update the `config.json` file and run this command:

```plaintext
ts-node ~/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-v2-cli.ts update_candy_machine -e devnet -k ~/.config/solana/devnet.json -cp config.json
```

### ðŸ˜¡Â **Error to be aware of.**

If at any point you run into an error that looks like this:

```plaintext
/Users/flynn/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-v2-cli.ts:53
      return fs.readdirSync(`${val}`).map(file => path.join(val, file));
                      ^
TypeError: Cannot read property 'candyMachineAddress' of undefined
    at /Users/flynn/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-v2-cli.ts:649:53
    at step (/Users/flynn/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-v2-cli.ts:53:23)
    at Object.next (/Users/flynn/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-v2-cli.ts:34:53)
    at fulfilled (/Users/flynn/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-v2-cli.ts:25:58)
    at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:96:5)
```

Then it means the command can't access the `.cache` folder with the important data around your candy machine and NFTs. So if you get this error, be 100% sure you're running your candy machine commands from the same directory where you `.cache` and `assets` folders are. This is really easy to mess up since you might be in the ```app``` directory editing your web app and updating the candy machine in the future; double check your directory!!

### ðŸš¨ Progress Report
