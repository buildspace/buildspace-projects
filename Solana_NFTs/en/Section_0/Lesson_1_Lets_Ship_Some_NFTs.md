## 💎 Let's ship some freaking NFTs on Solana

### 👋 Welcome

You've made it — hell yeah! Welcome :). My name is Farza and I’m just the guy who will be chatting with yah here.

This project is for devs that want to get into Solana which is now one of the biggest blockchains in the world.

All you really need to know going into this is **some terminal skills, some javascript, and some React.js**. You'll pick up the rest along the way. **No Rust knowledge required.**

Few action items for you before moving on:

1. **Connect your Discord in the project dashboard.** All the good stuff is going to be happening in a secret category in the Discord that you'll only have access to once you connect your Discord.
2. **Connect your Ethereum wallet in the project dashboard.** We'll airdrop you an NFT once you finish this, and if you don't have a wallet connected we won't be able to airdrop it to you!! **We plan to do NFTs on Solana**, but, for now our whole system is built on Ethereum/Polygon so that's where we'll send the NFTs :).
3. **Be sure to attend the live kick-off**. If you miss it, no worries. It's not required to attend! The recording will be posted in Discord under **#info-board**.

### 🛠 The project

### 🤚 How to get help

When you have a question, hit up the proper channel for the project.

This project is broken up into 4 sections. You can see what section you're on by checking out the progress bar at the very top of the page in your buildspace dashboard. So, for example, if you're stuck on some part of Section 3, you'd hit up `#section-3-help` in the Discord. If you're part of multiple projects, be sure to ask your questions in the right project category!

### 🚨 Progress Report

_Please do this else Farza will be sad :(_

Hey! Go ahead and say gm in `#gm-only` on Discord. This is very important. Extremely important.
