We pretty much have a basic API now â€” right :)?

We're able to **POST** data and we're able to **GET** data.

Let's hook up our web app with our program! What we'll need to do is deploy to the devnet. This is a network run by Solana that runs on fake SOL.

Technically, we *could* deploy our program locally w/ `solana-test-validator` and build our web app using the local program â€” but here at buildspace we're pretty interested in getting to prod as quickly as possible :). Why mess around locally when we can deploy to the actual blockchain!?! Hehe.

Plus, I think it's easier to build the web app once we deploy our Solana program to devnet! Let's do this.

*Note: Make sure `solana-test-validator` is **not** running anywhere.*

### ðŸŒ³ Set up your environment for devnet.

It's actually pretty tricky to deploy to devnet. Stay with me here and make sure not to miss any steps :).

First, switch to devnet:

```bash
solana config set --url devnet
```

Once you do that, run:

```bash
solana config get
```

And you'll see that you're now pointing to [`https://api.devnet.solana.com`](https://api.devnet.solana.com/). This is how Anchor will know where to deploy to!

From here, we'll need to airdrop ourselves some SOL on the devnet. It's actually pretty easy, we just run twice:

```bash
solana airdrop 2
```

Now, run:

```bash
solana balance
```

And you should see 4 fake SOL in your wallet! This is actually retrieving your balance on devnet!

*Note: sometimes you'll get an error that says something like "insufficient funds" â€” whenever that happens just airdrop yourself `2` SOL like above. Note: `2` is the max you can airdrop yourself at a time right now. So, you'll need to refresh your wallet occasionally.*

### âœ¨ Changing up some variables.

Now, we need to change some variables in `Anchor.toml`. This is where it gets a little tricky.

In `Anchor.toml`, change `[programs.localnet]` to `[programs.devnet]`.

Then, change `cluster = "localnet"` to `cluster = "devnet"`.

Now, run:

```bash
anchor build
```

This will create a new build for us with a program id. We can access it by running:

```bash
solana address -k target/deploy/myepicproject-keypair.json
```

This will output your program id, **copy it**. We'll talk about it more in a second.

Now, go to `lib.rs`. You'll see this id at the top.

```bash
declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");
```

So...what is this? It confused me a lot when I was first researching lol.

Basically, it's an id initially generated by `anchor init` that specifies our program's id.

That's important because the id of the program specifies how to load and execute the program and contains info on how the Solana runtime should execute the program.

The program id also helps the Solana runtime see all the accounts created by the program itself â€” so, remember how our program creates "accounts" that hold data related to the program? Well, with this ID Solana can quickly see all the accounts generated by the program and easily reference them.

So, **we need to change this program id** in `declare_id!` to the one output by `solana address -k target/deploy/myepicproject-keypair.json`. Why? Well, the one `anchor init` gave us was just a placeholder. Now we'll have a program id we can actually deploy with!

*Note: everyone's program id will be different! It's generated by Anchor.*

Now, go to `Anchor.toml` and under `[programs.devnet]` you'll see something like `myepicproject = "Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS"`. Go ahead and change this id to the same id output when you run `solana address -k target/deploy/myepicproject-keypair.json`.

Great, so you changed your program id in two spots!

Finally, once you do all this we need to run the build command again:

```bash
anchor build
```

Why? Because we want to actually build the project w/ our new program id! Anchor generates certain files upon a build under the `target` directory and we want to make sure those generated files have the latest and greatest program id.

**That was a lot of steps. It's easy to mess up and get a random, confusing error. To summarize:**

```
solana config set --url devnet

// Make sure you're on devnet.
solana config get

anchor build

// Get the new program id.
solana address -k target/deploy/myepicproject-keypair.json

// Update Anchor.toml and lib.rs w/ new program id.
// Make sure Anchor.toml is on devnet.

// Build again.
anchor build
```

### ðŸš€ Deploy to devnet!

And finally, you're good to deploy :)! Go ahead and run:

```bash
anchor deploy
```

You should see the word "Deploy success" :).

Once you do, you head to the [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet) to see if it all worked! *Note: make sure you go to the top right, click "Mainnet" and then click "Devnet" since we deployed to Devnet.*

On the explorer, paste in your program id (the same one we had from `solana address -k target/deploy/myepicproject-keypair.json`) and search for it.

You'll see your deployed program!! Scroll down and see the transaction history and you'll see the deployment right there.

**YO â€” YOU JUST DEPLOYED TO THE ACTUAL SOLANA BLOCKCHAIN. NICE.**

This of course is not "Mainnet", but the "Devnet" is run by actual miners and is legit.

**There aren't that many "Solana developers". So this point you're probably in the top 10% of Solana developers lol. Congrats!**

*Note: From this point on, please don't make changes to lib.rs until I say so. Basically, whenever you change your program you need to redeploy and follow the steps above all over again. I always easily miss steps and get weird bugs lol. Let's focus on the web app now, and after I'll show you a good workflow for changing your program + redeploying after!*

### ðŸš¨ Progress Report

*Please do this else Farza will be sad :(*

You deployed a Solana program!!! Hell yes!! Go ahead and post the Solana Explorer link to your deployed program in `#progress`.

This is also a good time to tweet out that you're learning about Solana and just deployed your first program to the Solana Devnet. Inspire others to join web3!

Be sure to include your Solana Explorer link and attach a screenshot of your deployed program as well perhaps. Or, add a screenshot of it on Solana Explorer!! Tag `@_buildspace` if you're feeling fancy ;).
