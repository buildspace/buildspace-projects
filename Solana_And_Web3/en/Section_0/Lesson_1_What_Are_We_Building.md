### 👋 Welcome

You've made it — hell yeah! Welcome :). My name is Farza and I’m just the guy who will be chatting with yah here.

This project is for devs that want to get into Solana which is now one of the biggest blockchains in the world.

All you really need to know going into this is **some terminal skills, some javascript, and some React.js**. You'll pick up the rest along the way. **No Rust knowledge required.**

Few action items for you before moving on:

1. **Connect your Discord in the project dashboard.** All the good stuff is going to be happening in a secret category in the Discord that you'll only have access to once you connect your Discord.
2. **Connect your Ethereum wallet in the project dashboard.** We'll airdrop you an NFT once you finish this, and if you don't have a wallet connected we won't be able to airdrop it to you!! **We plan to do NFTs on Solana**, but, for now our whole system is built on Ethereum/Polygon so that's where we'll send the NFTs :).
3. **Be sure to attend the live kick-off**. If you miss it, no worries. It's not required to attend! The recording will be posted in Discord under **#info-board**.

### 🛠 The project

So what will we be building here :)? Here's a little video:

### 💎 Earning an NFT

When you reach the end of this project, you'll be able to earn an NFT.

You'll only be eligible for the NFT if you finish it within 60 days of signing up! So make sure you schedule time to finish, you got this!

**Once you finish the project, you'll get the NFT airdropped within 7 days**

Here's what it looks like:

**Note: Each cohort is named after a star (ex. [Alkes](https://www.star-facts.com/alkes/), [Beid](https://www.universeguide.com/star/19587/beid), etc)! Also, the # at the bottom will be the # minted which depends on when you finish! Each NFT is unique.** 

### 🤚 How to get help

When you have a question, hit up the proper channel for the project.

This project is broken up into 4 sections. You can see what section you're on by checking out the progress bar at the very top of the page in your buildspace dashboard. So, for example, if you're stuck on some part of Section 3, you'd hit up `#section-3-help` in the Discord. If you're part of multiple projects, be sure to ask your questions in the right project category!

### 🤘 See an issue? Want to improve something? Fix it yourself ;)

**[All this content is completely open-source](https://github.com/buildspace/buildspace-projects)**. If you see an issue, typo, etc — you can fix it yourself easily and make a PR! If you need help doing this, DM `@alec` in the Discord :).

At the very least, drop a ⭐ on the repo if you're feeling fancy!

Let's get you some open-source rep!!!

### 👀 **Curious about working in web3?**

**People seem to think web3 just needs people who can code smart contracts or write code that interfaces w/ the blockchain. Not true.**

There is so much work to do and most of the work doesn't even have to do w/ smart contracts lol. Being an engineer in web3 just means you take your web2 skills and apply them to web3.

Web3 also desperately needs designers, product managers, marketers, and more.

**We're partnered with a bunch of awesome web3 companies that want to hire people from the buildspace network.**

We got companies like OpenSea, Edge and Node, and Chainlink as partners. **Even if you're just curious**, click "Work in Web3" on the side-bar, fill out the form real quick, and check out the opportunities!!

Worst case scenario, you get to talk to some really cool people in web3.

Just do it really quick right now :).
