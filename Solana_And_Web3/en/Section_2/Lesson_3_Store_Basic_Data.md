Right now, our program does literally nothing haha. Let's change it up to store some data! 

Our website will allow people to submit GIFs. So, storing something like a `total_gifs` number would be pretty helpful too.

### ü•û Create an integer to store GIF count.

Cool so we just want to store a basic integer with the number of `total_gifs` people have submitted. So, every time someone adds a new gif we'd just do `total_gifs += 1`.

Let's think about this. 

Remember earlier I said Solana programs are **stateless**. They **don't** hold data permanently. This is very different from the world of Ethereum smart contracts ‚Äî which hold state right on the contract.

But, Solana programs can interact w/ "accounts".

Again, accounts are basically files that programs can read and write to. The word "accounts" is confusing and super shitty. For example, when you create a wallet on Solana ‚Äî you create an "account". But, your program can also make an "account" that it can write data to. Programs themselves are considered "accounts". 

**Everything is an account lol**. Just remember an account isn't just like your actual wallet ‚Äî **it's a general way for programs to pass data between each other**. Read about them more [here](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/accounts). 

Check out the code below, I added some comments as well.

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");

#[program]
pub mod myepicproject {
  use super::*;
  pub fn start_stuff_off(ctx: Context<StartStuffOff>) -> ProgramResult {
    // Get a reference to the account.
    let base_account = &mut ctx.accounts.base_account;
    // Initialize total_gifs.
    base_account.total_gifs = 0;
    Ok(())
  }
}

// Attach certain variables to the StartStuffOff context.
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct StartStuffOff<'info> {
    #[account(init, payer = user, space = 9000)]
    pub base_account: Account<'info, BaseAccount>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program <'info, System>,
}

// Tell Solana what we want to store on this account.
#[account]
pub struct BaseAccount {
    pub total_gifs: u64,
}
```

**A lot happening here.** Let's step through it.

### ü§† Initializing an account.

Lets check out this line at the bottom:

```rust
#[account]
pub struct BaseAccount {
    pub total_gifs: u64,
}
```

This is dope. Basically, it tells our program what kind of account it can make and what to hold inside of it. So, here, `BaseAccount` holds one thing and it's an integer named `total_gifs`.

Then, here we actually specify how to initialize it and what to hold in our `StartStuffOff` context.

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct StartStuffOff<'info> {
    #[account(init, payer = user, space = 9000)]
    pub base_account: Account<'info, BaseAccount>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program <'info, System>,
}
```

Looks complicated lol.

First we've got `[account(init, payer = user, space = 9000)]`. **All we're doing here is telling Solana how we want to initialize `BaseAccount`.**

Note, if after running your test below you get the error `Transaction simulation failed: Error processing Instruction 0: custom program error: 0x64`, you will need to change `space = 9000` to `space = 10000`. If you look at [these docs from anchor](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/tutorials/tutorial-1.html#defining-a-program) you can see that they define a simple program that declares space = 8 + 8 (eg, 8 kilobytes + 8 kilobytes). The more logic we add to our program, the more space it will take up!

1. `init` will tell Solana to create a new account owned by our current program.
2. `payer = user` tells our program who's paying for the account to be created. In this case, it's the `user` calling the function. 
3. We then say `space = 9000` which will allocate 9000 bytes of space for our account. You can change this # if you wanted, but, 9000 bytes is enough for the program we'll be building here!

Why are we paying for an account? Well ‚Äî storing data isn't free! How Solana works is users will pay "rent" on their accounts. You can read more on it [here](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/accounts#rent) and how rent is calculated. Pretty wild, right? If you don't pay rent, validators will clear the account!

[Here's](https://docs.solana.com/storage_rent_economics) another article from the docs on rent I liked as well!

> "With this approach, accounts with two-years worth of rent deposits secured are exempt from network rent charges. By maintaining this minimum-balance, the broader network benefits from reduced liquidity and the account holder can rest assured that their¬†`Account::data`¬†will be retained for continual access/usage."
> 

We then have `pub user: Signer<'info>` which is data passed into the program that proves to the program that the user calling this program actually owns their wallet account.

Finally, we have `pub system_program: Program` which is actually pretty freaking cool. It's basically a reference to the [SystemProgram](https://docs.solana.com/developing/runtime-facilities/programs#system-program). The SystemProgram is the program that basically runs Solana. It is responsible for a lot of stuff, but one of the main things it does is create accounts on Solana. The SystemProgram is a program the creators of Solana deployed that other programs like ours talk to haha ‚Äî it has an id of `11111111111111111111111111111111`.

Lastly, we do this thing in our function where we just grab `base_account` from the `StartStuffOff` context by doing `Context<StartStuffOff>`.

```rust
pub fn start_stuff_off(ctx: Context<StartStuffOff>) -> ProgramResult {
	// Get a reference to the account.
  let base_account = &mut ctx.accounts.base_account;
	// Initialize total_gifs.
  base_account.total_gifs = 0;
  Ok(())
}
```

Boom! Again ‚Äî a lot of this stuff may seem confusing especially if you're new to Rust but **let's just keep writing and running code**. I think this stuff makes more sense the more you do write code ‚Üí run ‚Üí get errors ‚Üí fix errors ‚Üí repeat.

*Note: We do `&mut` to get a "mutable reference" to `base_account`. When we do this it actually gives us the power to make **changes** to `base_account`. Otherwise, we'd simply be working w/ a "local copy" of `base_account`.*

### üëã  Retrieve account data.

Let's put it all together.

So, we can actually retrieve account data now as well over in javascript land. Go ahead and update `myepicproject.js`. I added some comments on lines I changed.

```javascript
const anchor = require('@project-serum/anchor');

// Need the system program, will talk about this soon.
const { SystemProgram } = anchor.web3;

const main = async() => {
  console.log("üöÄ Starting test...")

  // Create and set the provider. We set it before but we needed to update it, so that it can communicate with our frontend!
  const provider = anchor.Provider.env();
  anchor.setProvider(provider);

  const program = anchor.workspace.Myepicproject;
	
  // Create an account keypair for our program to use.
  const baseAccount = anchor.web3.Keypair.generate();

  // Call start_stuff_off, pass it the params it needs!
  let tx = await program.rpc.startStuffOff({
    accounts: {
      baseAccount: baseAccount.publicKey,
      user: provider.wallet.publicKey,
      systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
    },
    signers: [baseAccount],
  });

  console.log("üìù Your transaction signature", tx);

  // Fetch data from the account.
  let account = await program.account.baseAccount.fetch(baseAccount.publicKey);
  console.log('üëÄ GIF Count', account.totalGifs.toString())
}

const runMain = async () => {
  try {
    await main();
    process.exit(0);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
};

runMain();
```

`anchor.web3.Keypair.generate()` may also be kinda confusing ‚Äî why are we doing this? Well, basically it's because we need to create some credentials for the `BaseAccount` we're creating.

Most of the script is the same but you'll see I pass `startStuffOff` some important params that we specified in the struct `pub struct StartStuffOff`.

*Note: notice also that in `lib.rs` the function is called `start_stuff_off` since in Rust we use snake case (`snake_case`) instead of camel case. But, over in our javascript file we use camel case and actually call `startStuffOff`. This is something nice Anchor does for us so we can follow best practices regardless of what language we're using. You can use snake case in Rust-land and camel case in JS-land.*

And perhaps the coolest part about all this is where we call:

```javascript
await program.account.baseAccount.fetch(baseAccount.publicKey)
console.log('üëÄ GIF Count', account.totalGifs.toString())
```

Here we actually retrieve the account we created and then access `totalGifs`. When I run this via `anchor test`, I get:

```
üöÄ Starting test...
üìù Your transaction signature 2KiCcXmdDyhMhJpnYpWXQy3FxuuqnNSANeaH1CBjvomuLZ8LfzDKHtDDB2LHfsfoVQZSyxoF1R39ao6VfTrD7bG7
üëÄ GIF Count 0
```

Yay! It's `0`! This is pretty freaking epic. We now are actually calling a program *and* storing data in a permissionless manner on the Solana chain. NICE.

### üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Build a function to update GIF counter.

Let's actually create a new function named `add_gif` that lets us actually increment the GIF counter. Check out some of my changes below.

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");

#[program]
pub mod myepicproject {
  use super::*;
  pub fn start_stuff_off(ctx: Context<StartStuffOff>) -> ProgramResult {
    let base_account = &mut ctx.accounts.base_account;
    base_account.total_gifs = 0;
    Ok(())
  }
  
	// Another function woo!
  pub fn add_gif(ctx: Context<AddGif>) -> ProgramResult {
    // Get a reference to the account and increment total_gifs.
    let base_account = &mut ctx.accounts.base_account;
    base_account.total_gifs += 1;
    Ok(())
  }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct StartStuffOff<'info> {
  #[account(init, payer = user, space = 9000)]
  pub base_account: Account<'info, BaseAccount>,
  #[account(mut)]
  pub user: Signer<'info>,
  pub system_program: Program <'info, System>,
}

// Specify what data you want in the AddGif Context.
// Getting a handle on the flow of things :)?
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct AddGif<'info> {
  #[account(mut)]
  pub base_account: Account<'info, BaseAccount>,
}

#[account]
pub struct BaseAccount {
    pub total_gifs: u64,
}
```

Pretty simple! Near the bottom I added:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct AddGif<'info> {
  #[account(mut)]
  pub base_account: Account<'info, BaseAccount>,
}
```

I create a `Context` named `AddGif` that has access to a mutable reference to `base_account`. That's why I do `#[account(mut)]`. Basically it means I can actually change the `total_gifs` value stored on `BaseAccount`.

Otherwise, I may change data on it within my function but it *wouldn't actually change* on my account. Now, w/ a "mutable" reference if I mess w/ `base_account` in my function it'll change data on the account itself.

Last, I create a lil `add_gif` function!

```rust
pub fn add_gif(ctx: Context<AddGif>) -> ProgramResult {
    // Get a reference to the account and increment total_gifs.
    let base_account = &mut ctx.accounts.base_account;
    base_account.total_gifs += 1;
    Ok(())
}
```

All I do is grab the `base_account` which was passed in to the function via `Context<AddGif>`. Then, I increment the counter and that's it!!

Hope you can kinda see how the `Context` we set up near the bottom of the program actually becomes useful within the function. It's basically a nice way to say, "Hey, when someone calls `add_gif` be sure to attach the `AddGif` context to it as well so the user can access the `base_account` and whatever else is attached to `AddGif`.

### üåà Update the test script...again!

Every time we update our program, we need to change up our script to test the changes! Let's update `myepicproject.js` to call `add_gif`.

```javascript
const anchor = require('@project-serum/anchor');
const { SystemProgram } = anchor.web3;

const main = async() => {
  console.log("üöÄ Starting test...")

  const provider = anchor.Provider.env();
  anchor.setProvider(provider);

  const program = anchor.workspace.Myepicproject;
  const baseAccount = anchor.web3.Keypair.generate();
  let tx = await program.rpc.startStuffOff({
    accounts: {
      baseAccount: baseAccount.publicKey,
      user: provider.wallet.publicKey,
      systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
    },
    signers: [baseAccount],
  });
  console.log("üìù Your transaction signature", tx);

  let account = await program.account.baseAccount.fetch(baseAccount.publicKey);
  console.log('üëÄ GIF Count', account.totalGifs.toString())
	
  // Call add_gif!
  await program.rpc.addGif({
    accounts: {
      baseAccount: baseAccount.publicKey,
    },
  });
  
  // Get the account again to see what changed.
  account = await program.account.baseAccount.fetch(baseAccount.publicKey);
  console.log('üëÄ GIF Count', account.totalGifs.toString())
}

const runMain = async () => {
  try {
    await main();
    process.exit(0);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
};

runMain();
```

When I run this via `anchor test` I get:

```bash
üöÄ Starting test...
üìù Your transaction signature 2Z9LZc5sFr8GHvwjZkrkqGJZ1hFNzZq2rTPV7jSEUjFoMZ16QQwPS2B7qqyNrmfFEpodHTBhvt5oSBi958mbwiR8
üëÄ GIF Count 0
üëÄ GIF Count 1
```

NICE. We are now actually storing *and* changing data on our Solana program. Epic. 

*Note: You'll notice when you run `anchor test` again it'll start the counter from 0 again. Why? Well ‚Äî basically it's because whenever we run `anchor test` we generate a key pair for our account via `anchor.web3.Keypair.generate()`. This will actually create a new account every time. On our web app ‚Äî we'll make sure to address this properly. But for testing purposes it's useful because we can start w/ a fresh account every time we test.*

### üö® Progress Report

*Please do this else Farza will be sad :(*

Post a screenshot of your terminal showing your GIF count incrementing in `#progress`!

Epic work so far :).
