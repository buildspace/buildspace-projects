Before we begin, please watch [this](https://giphy.com/clips/hamlet-jJjb9AUHOiP3nJJMdy) very important video be sure to unmute it by hovering over it.

Okay, once that's out of the way let's move on!

We're going to kick things off w/ one of the most magical things about web3, connecting to a product with your wallet.

We'll allow our user to essentially "auth" with their Solana wallet. Building auth is usually pretty hard. You need to have a database of usernames, password, etc.

In this case it's **a lot** easier than you may think! Here's the plan:

1. Get the base web app code for this project (I provided some starter HTML/CSS so you can focus on the things that truly matter lol).
2. Write the code that will allow users to connect their Solana wallet and connect to your app to setup a basic "auth" state.
3. Hop into writing your first Solana program w/ Rust + deploy to the actual blockchain.

It's going to be **PRETTY HYPE.** 

One thing we really love at buildspace is the insane creativity people put into their projects. Make this project your own and do things however you see fit.

**If all you're doing is copy/pasting code then this won't be that fun.**

The base web app code I provide is just to get you started. Change things up. Maybe you hate the colors I used. Change it. Maybe you want to make the site more anime themed. Do it.

If you end up changing things up, tag me in `#progress` and say -  "Yo Farza I made your code better" and drop a screenshot.

Alright - let's do this.

### 🏁 **Getting started**

We are going to be using **React.js** to build our web app. If you are already familiar with React, this will be a breeze. If you haven't done much React, don't worry! You can still make it through this project, but it may feel a bit more difficult.

Don't give up, though! The more you struggle the more you learn 🧠.

If you have no experience w/ React - [checkout this intro series](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) before you get started with this section or maybe check out the intro docs [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html). Or don't do anything special, just hop in. **Whatever works for you :).**

You'll be a React Wizard after this project if you aren't already 🧙‍♂!

### ⬇️ Getting the code

We'll be using this thing called [Replit](https://replit.com/~)!

It is a browser-based IDE that lets us easily build web apps and deploy them all from the browser. It is super legit. Instead of having to set up a full local environment and write commands to deploy, it's all just given to us.

Note: **You don't have to use replit to build + deploy your site. If you want to work locally on VSCode and use Vercel/Heroku/AWS to deploy and are confident in your web dev skills -- that's totally cool. [Here is the link](https://github.com/buildspace/gif-portal-starter) to the base repo you can clone and work on locally.**

If you decide to go with Replit, make an account with them before moving on!

I've already created a basic react project that you can **fork** on Replit.

[Just click here](https://replit.com/@adilanchian/gif-portal-starter-project?v=1)**, and near the right you'll see the "Fork" button.** Be sure you're logged in, then click this.

You'll magically clone my repo and full IDE in your browser to work with the code. Once it stops loading and shows you some code click "run" at the top and you're good to go. Might take 2-4 min the first time.

**Please Note: As you go through this project, you may notice that we are referencing `.js` files. In Replit, if you are creating any new JavaScript files, you will need to use the `.jsx` extension instead! Replit has some performance fanciness that requires you use the `.jsx` file extension :).**

Here's a quick video I made for a different project going over some Replit basics:

Just like that, you have a frontend setup for your web3 app 😎.

### 🚨 Progress Report

*Please do this else Farza will be sad :(*

Post a screenshot of your starter web app in `#progress` :).
