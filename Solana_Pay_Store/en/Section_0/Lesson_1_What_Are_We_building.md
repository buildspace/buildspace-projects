You’ve made it — hell yeah! Welcome :). My name is Raza and I’m going to be your emoji salesman!

You're going to join the exclusive club of hackers that get paid for their stuff using Solana Pay!

Word on the street is you gotta hit $83k MRR to "make it". This is how we do it. **We're gonna SELL GOODS AND SERVICES.**

Now that OpenSea has added Solana, the cool kids have something new to gamble their money on - composable, 0.2s, <0.001$ transactions to buy 3D monkey pictures.

This is our moment to shine - they don't know how tax works and can't cash out their 14x gains or the IRS will come knocking. We love all liquidity, and we're going to save theirs by letting them buy stuff using Solana Pay!

Few action items for you before moving on:

Connect your Discord in the project dashboard. All the good stuff is going to be happening in a secret category in the Discord that you'll only have access to once you connect your Discord.
Connect your Ethereum wallet on the project dashboard. We'll airdrop you an NFT once you finish this, and if you don't have a wallet connected we won't be able to airdrop it to you!!
Be sure to attend the live kick-off. If you miss it, no worries. It's not required to attend! The recording will be posted in Discord under #info-board.

### 🛠 The project
So what will we be building here :)? Here's a little video:

### 💎 Earning an NFT
When you reach the end of this project, you'll earn an NFT. 

You'll only be eligible for the NFT if you finish it within 60 days of signing up! So make sure you schedule time to finish, you got this!

**Once you finish the project, you'll get the NFT airdropped within 7 days**

Here's what it looks like:

### 🤚 How to get help
When you have a question, hit up the proper channel for the project.

This project is broken up into 4 sections. You can see what section you're on by checking out the progress bar at the very top of the page in your buildspace dashboard. So, for example, if you're stuck on some part of Section 3, you'd hit up #section-3-help in the Discord. If you're part of multiple projects, be sure to ask your questions in the right project category!

### 🤘 See an issue? Want to improve something? Fix it yourself ;)
All this content is completely open-source. If you see an issue, typo, etc — you can fix it yourself easily and make a PR! If you need help doing this, DM @alec in the Discord :). At the very least, drop a ⭐ on the repo if you're feeling fancy! Let's get you some open-source rep!!!

### 👀 Curious about working in web3?
People seem to think web3 just needs people who can code smart contracts or write code that interfaces w/ the blockchain. Not true.

There is so much work to do and most of the work doesn't even have to do with smart contracts lol. Being an engineer in web3 just means you take your web2 skills and apply them to web3.

Web3 also desperately needs designers, product managers, marketers, and more.

We're partnered with a bunch of awesome web3 companies that want to hire people from the buildspace network.

We got companies like OpenSea, Edge and Node, and Chainlink as partners. Even if you're just curious, click "Work" in the header and check out the opportunities!!

Worst case scenario, you get to talk to some really cool people in web3.

### 🚨 Progress Report
Please do this else Raza will be sad :(

Hey! Go ahead and say gm in #gm-only on Discord. This is very important. Extremely important. If you don't do this then all of humanity will collectively jump and disrupt the Earth's orbit causing it to collide with Venus.

BTW -- if you want to make a tweet telling the world that you're building an app with Solana Pay today and tag @_buildspace, go for it!

We always say this, but 1) that tweet could inspire someone else to join web3 and 2) it supports us!
