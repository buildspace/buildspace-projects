### 👋 Welcome

You’ve made it — hell yeah! **Welcome :)**. My name is Raza and I’m going to be your installation wizard to the blockchain.

This project is for devs who want to understand web3 apps by just building one themselves. All you really need to know going into this:

- **some terminal skills**
- **some Javascript**
- **some react.js**

You'll pick up the rest along the way.

Few action items for you before moving on:

1. **Connect your Discord in the project dashboard.** All the good stuff is going to be happening in a secret category in the Discord that you'll only have access to once you connect your Discord.
2. **Connect your Ethereum wallet in the project dashboard.** We'll airdrop you an NFT once you finish this, and if you don't have a wallet connected we won't be able to airdrop it to you!!
3. **Be sure to attend the live kick-off**. If you miss it, no worries. It's not required to attend! The recording will be posted in Discord under **#info-board**.

### 🚀 This is going to be awesome

I’m super excited to show you how to go from zero → shipping your own web3 app on a Polygon L2.

What does "shipping" mean? Well, it means you'll actually make something and then deploy it to the internet for the world to see and use. You'll be able to show the final project off to your friends, potential employers, and even your dog! The best part is, your fellow buildspacers will be the first users for your project!!

This stuff is very new, there's a lot of hype around it, and it can be super difficult to understand. The best way to learn it is by doing.

With this project, you're going to learn about crypto tech by actually writing code and just hopping into the good stuff. No B.S. We'll also go over theory and more in-depth concepts, but, it will all be structured around your project.

### 💎 Earning an NFT

When you reach the end of this project, you'll be able to earn an NFT.

**You'll only be eligible for the NFT if you finish it within 60 days of signing up.** So make sure you schedule time to finish, you got this!

**Once you finish the project, you'll get the NFT airdropped within 7 days.**

Here's what it looks like:

**Note: It can take up to 7 days for your NFT to arrive (you'll get an email also!). If it's been more than 7 days please reach out to either Raza (TooManyBugs#3359) or Alec (alec#8853) on Discord!**

### 🤚 How to get help

When you have a question, hit up the proper channel for the project.

This project is broken up into 4 sections. You can see what section you're on by checking out the progress bar at the very top of the page in your buildspace dashboard. So, for example, if you're stuck on some part of Section 3, you'd hit up `#section-3-help` in the Discord. If you're part of multiple projects, be sure to ask your questions in the right project category!

### 🤘 See an issue? Want to improve something? Fix it yourself ;)

**[All this content is completely open-source](https://github.com/buildspace/buildspace-projects)**. If you see an issue, typo, etc — you can fix it yourself easily and make a PR! If you need help doing this, DM `@alec` in the Discord :).

At the very least, drop a ⭐ on the repo if you're feeling fancy!

Let's get you some open-source rep!!!

### 🚨 Progress Report

_Please do this else Raza will be sad :(_

Hey! Go ahead and say GTFOL in `#gtfol` on Discord. This is very important. Extremely important.

If you don't do this then all of humanity will collectively jump and disrupt the Earth's orbit causing it to collide with Venus.

**BTW -- if you want to make a tweet telling the world that you're building your own ENS today and tag [@_buildspace](https://twitter.com/_buildspace), go for it!**

**We always say this, but 1) that tweet could inspire someone else to join web3 and 2) it supports us!**
