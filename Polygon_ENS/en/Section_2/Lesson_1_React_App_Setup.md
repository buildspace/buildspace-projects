### 🏁 Getting started with React.js

Now this is where the fun **REALLY** starts. Writing and deploying your smart contract is one thing, but building a portal where anyone in the world can interact with the blockchain is just pure magic ✨.

We are going to be using **React.js** to build our web app. If you are already familiar with React, this will be a breeze. If you haven't done much React, don't worry! You can still make it through this project, but it may feel a bit more difficult. 

Don't give up! The more you struggle the more you learn 🧠.

If you have no experience w/ React - [checkout this intro series](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) before you get started with this section or at least check out the intro docs [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html). Or don't do anything special, just hop in. Whatever works for you :). You'll be an absolute React Wizard after this project if you aren't already 🧙‍♂!

### 🤯 Replit!

We'll be using this thing called [Replit](https://replit.com/~)! It is a browser-based IDE that lets us easily build web apps and deploy them all from the browser. It is super legit. Instead of having to set up a full local environment and write commands to deploy, it's all just given to us.

Make an account on Replit before moving on.

I've already created a basic react project that you can **fork** on Replit. **[Just click here](https://replit.com/@almostEfficient/domain-starter-project), and near the right you'll see the "Fork" button.** Be sure you're logged in, then click this.

You'll magically clone my repo and the full IDE in your browser to work with the code. Once it stops loading and shows you some code click "run" at the top and you're good to go. Might take 2-4 min the first time.

**Please Note: As you go through this project, you may notice that we are referencing `.js` files. In Replit, if you are creating any new JavaScript files, you will need to use the `.jsx` extension instead! Replit has some performance fanciness that requires you use the `.jsx` file extension :)**

### 👩‍💻 Want to work locally? Get the code

If you don’t wanna use Replit, you don’t have to.

Start by heading over [here](https://github.com/AlmostEfficient/domain-starter) where you find the starter repo code. From here you're going to want to make sure you press the "Fork" button at the top right of the page:

Sweet! When you fork this repo, you are actually creating an identical copy of it that lives under your Github profile. So now you have your own version of this code that you can edit to your hearts content.

The final step here is to actually get your newly forked repo on your local machine. Click the "Code" button and copy that link!

Head to your terminal and `cd` into whatever directory your project will live in. For example, I like to clone my projects to my `Developer` folder. Depends on what you like! Once you find the spot, just clone the repo by running:

```bash
git clone YOUR_FORKED_LINK
cd domain-starter
```

That's it! From there go ahead and run:

```bash
npm install
```

And then:

```bash
npm start
```

That should open up the app in your browser on `localhost:3000`. Your app is empty right now, just how we want it. This is going to be our blank canvas which we will spice up to our liking. For now, just update the page titles to whatever you want! 

Mine looks like this:
