👋 Welcome
-------------------

You've made it — hell yeah! Welcome :). My name is Farza and I’ll be your instructor. This project is for devs that want to get more into crypto tech. All you really need to know going into this: some terminal skills, some javascript, some react.js. You'll pick up the rest along the way.

Few action items for you before moving on:

1. **Connect your Discord in the course dashboard.** All the good stuff is going to be happening in a secret category in the Discord that you'll only have access to if you connect your Discord.
2. **Connect your Ethereum wallet in the course dashboard.** If you don't have a wallet that can interact with dApps, you can just install Metamask for free right now. Without a wallet, you can't do the project!
3. **Be sure to attend the kick-off**. If you miss it, no worries. It's not required to attend! The recording will be posted in Discord.

🚀 This is going to be awesome
-------------------

I'm really excited to show you how to go from zero -> shipping your own NFTs.

What does "shipping" mean? Well, it means you'll actually make something and then deploy it to the internet for the world to see and use. You'll be able to show the final project off to your friends, potential employers, and even your dog! The best part is, your fellow classmates will be the first users for your project!!

This stuff is very new, there's a lot of hype around it, and it can be super difficult to understand the best way to learn it.

With this project, you're going to learn about crypto tech by actually writing code and just hopping into the good stuff. No B.S. We'll also go over theory and more in-depth concepts, but, it will all be structured around your project.

👀 Earn a _buildspace NFT by the end.
-------------------

When you reach the end of this project, you'll be able to earn an NFT.

**You can only claim an NFT if you finish the project within 7-days of the kick-off. After that, you won't be able to claim it!**

This NFT not only looks cool, but it will also get you access to secret opportunities in crypto such as — full-time work, internships, and contract work. This initiative is a work in progress :).

Note: instead of "Capella", yours would say name of your cohort — each cohort is named after a star! Also, the # at the bottom right will be the # minted which depends on when you claim the NFT.

To claim the NFT, you'll need to pay [gas fees](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/) which are fees that Ethereum charges you to perform transactions on the network. Gas fees to redeem the NFT vary. I recommend transferring around $30 - $50 worth of ETH over to your wallet.

If you don't know how to do this, don't worry about it for now — not required!

*Note: The project itself doesn't require you to have any real money at all! We'll still be deploying to the blockchain using something special Ethereum provides us called a "testnet".*

🛠 What we're building
-------------------

You know those websites where people are making millions of dollars where users can come and "mint" an NFT? We're building that.

Your project will let users connect their Ethereum wallet, and mint an NFT to their wallet so they actually own it. They'll even be able to re-sell the NFT on OpenSea. The NFT itself can be customized to whatever you want.

They'll even show up on OpenSea :).

You'll be able to customize the NFT itself as much as you want at the end and do whatever you want.

But, the NFTs I'll be going over in these guides are these NFTs that are basically a square box with a randomly generated three-word combination at the center. Why? Because I think it's funny lol. Some of these three-word combos are really fkin funny.

Coolest part? Everything will be happening *on-chain*. This means all the NFT data will live on the blockchain itself. If that doesn't make sense, don't worry just yet — it will :)!


💻 Co-Working Sessions
-------------------

Basically, co-working sessions at buildspace are specific times for you to work on your project for 1-hour. During the hour, the teaching assistants will be very active in the chat answering questions as well.

It's pretty cool. Everyone joins the #cowork-sesh voice channel at a scheduled time (all muted by default) and works individually on their projects with their classmates in a virtual space. We also play some nice lofi beats.

🤚 How to get help.
-------------------

When you have a question, hit up the proper channel for the project.

This project is broken up into 4 sections. You can see what section you're on by checking out the progress bar at the very top of the page. So, for example, if you're stuck on some part of Section 3, you'd hit up `#section-3-help` in the Discord.

Another great time to ask is during co-working sessions which are guaranteed times TAs will be online. During coworking sessions, you can ask questions in `#cowork-chat` on the Discord.

📺 Where does the Live Kick-Off Happen?
-------------------

They'll be happening at [https://www.twitch.tv/buildspace](https://www.twitch.tv/buildspace). Be sure to make an account on Twitch ahead of time so you'll be able to chat during the stream!

🚨BTW -- wanna work in crypto?
-------------------

We're partnered with a bunch of dope companies. We'll help you get hired in crypto. Even if you're just curious, fill out the form!! What's the worst that can happen -- you get connected to some dope crypto companies!?
