I see so many tutorials complicate this. So, I'll try to keep it pretty simple :).

An NFT is a "token" that a person can own that links to some piece of "data" (ex. a link to a piece of digital art, a video, an image, etc). The trick with NFTs is that each "token" has a unique identifier that lets the owner prove that it's one of a kind. We'll be seeing the code later :).

Let's go over an example real quick.

## üé® Picasso Sketches

Let's say Picasso wanted to create a collection of 100 of his sketches to sell.

We know that each sketch is unique because we can see it's a physical pencil drawing. So, it's obvious Picasso didn't just print a bunch of copies.

We also know that Picasso drew it. How? Well ‚Äî because Picasso said he drew it and signed it! You can buy this original Picasso sketch now and get a certificate proving you have a "Picasso Original" from the gallery Picasso sold it at.

You have to trust that the gallery certificate will be respected long-term, but, overall this is ezpz!

## üë®‚Äçüíª Picasso NFTs

Let's look at this example in **NFT land** now.

Let's say Picasso wanted to create a collection of 100 of his sketches where each sketch is a **digital drawing**, like a JPEG file.

Picasso would create his NFT collection by coding up his own "smart contract" (the code that runs all the logic for his NFT collection).

He'd give each piece of artwork a unique identifier (ex. Sketch #1, Sketch #2, Sketch #3, etc). Then, when Picasso is ready to "launch" his NFT collection he would launch it using his own Ethereum wallet to "sign" the NFT collection. When he's ready, he'll put it on the public blockchain ‚Äî where everyone can publicly see Picasso's NFT collection.

Then, when Picasso wants to sell one of the NFTs all he needs to do is "transfer" the NFT over to the person who bought it using the buyer's public wallet address.

The person who bought the NFT will be happy because they got a **one-of-a-kind, original Picasso! From Picasso himself!!!** And the best part? They can prove it!

How?

1. The buyer can prove that the NFT collection was originally signed and created by Picasso himself because the NFT would show that it came from a smart contract signed by Picasso. Remember, Picasso signed the collection with his public address! Usually, artists publicly announce their wallet address so no one can pretend to be them!

2. The buyer can prove that the NFT itself is a unique Picasso sketch from the collection because each NFT from the collection has a unique identifier (ex. Sketch #1, Sketch #2, Sketch #3, etc) that comes from the person who originally created the collection.

Okay, so, hope that makes *some sense*.

This is an extremely powerful concept ‚Äî the idea that any file can be made unique and valuable is amazing. It's also why you may be seeing Twitter going crazy about NFTs lately lol. NFTs are something that are already shifting art, gaming, and more.

I don't expect you to fully get it yet. If it makes zero sense, maybe read it again! Just make sure it makes a *tiny bit* of sense before moving on lol. I just want to give you a little bit of base knowledge.

Usually, I start really understanding stuff when I start coding. So, let's set up our local environment and hop into some code :).
