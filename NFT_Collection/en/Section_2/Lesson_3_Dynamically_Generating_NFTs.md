üî§ Randomly generate words on an image.
------------------

Cool ‚Äî we created a contract that's now minting NFTs all on-chain. But, it's still always the same NFT argh!!! Let's make it dynamic.

**I wrote out all the code [here](https://gist.github.com/farzaa/b788ba3a8dbaf6f1ef9af57eefa63c27) which will generate an SVG with a combination of three random words.**

I figure this would be the best way for people to kinda look at all the code at once and get a handle on how it's working.

I also wrote a comment above most of the lines I added/changed! When you look at this code, try and actually write it out yourself. Google the functions that you don't understand!

I do want to make a few notes on some of these lines.

üìù Pick your own words!
------------------

```solidity
string[] firstWords = ["YOUR_WORD", "YOUR_WORD", "YOUR_WORD", "YOUR_WORD", "YOUR_WORD", "YOUR_WORD"];

string[] secondWords = ["YOUR_WORD", "YOUR_WORD", "YOUR_WORD", "YOUR_WORD", "YOUR_WORD", "YOUR_WORD"];

string[] thirdWords = ["YOUR_WORD", "YOUR_WORD", "YOUR_WORD", "YOUR_WORD", "YOUR_WORD", "YOUR_WORD"];
```

These are our random words!! Please have fun with this. Just make sure each word is a single word with no spaces!

The funnier the words the better this will be lol. I liked making each array a certain theme. For example, `firstWords` could be the first names of your fav anime characters. Then, `secondWords` could be a food you like. And, `thirdWords` could be names of random animals. Have fun with it!!! Make this yours.

Here are some of mine. I like the first row to be words that feel like they "describe" something!

Perhaps you wanna generate random band name. Perhaps you wanna generate random character names for your Dungeons and Dragons games. Do whatever you want. Maybe you don't give a shit about three word combinations and just want to make SVGs of pixel art penguins. Go for it. Do whatever you want :).

Note: I recommend like 15-20 words per array. I've noticed around 10 it's usually not random enough. 

ü•¥ Random numbers.
------------------

```solidity
function pickRandomFirstWord
```

This function looks kinda funky. Right? Lets talk about how we're randomly picking stuff from the arrays.

So, generating a random number in smart contracts is widely known as a¬†**difficult problem**.

Why? Well, think about how a random number is generated normally. When you generate a random number normally in a program,¬†**it will take a bunch of different numbers from your computer as a source of randomness**¬†like: the speed of the fans, the temperature of the CPU, the number of times you've pressed "L" at 3:52PM since you've bought the computer, your internet speed, and tons of other #s that are difficult for you to control. It takes¬†**all**¬†these numbers that are "random" and puts them together into an algorithm that generates a number that it feels is the best attempt at a truly "random" number. Make sense?

On the blockchain, there is¬†**nearly no source of randomness**. It's deterministic and everything the contract sees, the public sees. Because of that, someone could game the system by just looking at the smart contract, seeing what #'s it relies on for randomness, and then the person could game it if they wanted to.


```solidity
random(string(abi.encodePacked("FIRST_WORD", Strings.toString(tokenId))));
```

What this is doing is it's taking two things: The actual string `FIRST_WORD` and a stringified version of the `tokenId`. I combine these two strings using `abi.encodePacked` and then that combined string is what I use as the source of randomness.

**This isn't true randomness.** But it's the best we got for now!

There are other ways to generate random numbers on the blockchain (check out [Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf/)) but Solidity doesn't natively give us anything reliable because it can't! All the #'s our contract can access are public and never truly random.

This can be a bit annoying for some application like ours here! In any case, no one is going to be attacking our tiny app but I want you to know all this when you're building¬†a dApp that has millions of users!

‚ú®  Creating the SVG dynamically.
------------------

Check out the variable `string baseSvg` on the contract. This looks wild lol. Basically, the only piece of our SVG that ever changes is the three-word combo, right? So what we do is we create a `baseSvg` variable we can reuse over and over as we create new NFTs.

We then put all together using:

```
string memory finalSvg = string(abi.encodePacked(baseSvg, first, second, third, "</text></svg>"));
```

`</text></svg>` are the closing tags! So for `finalSvg` we're saying, "Hey ‚Äî go combine my baseSVG, my three-word combo I just generated, and then my closing tags. That's it :)! It looks scary but all we're doing is working with the SVG code.

üòé Run it!
------------------------

Once you write it all out, go ahead and run it using `npx hardhat run scripts/run.js`. Check out what's output by `console.log(finalSvg);`.

Here's what I get in my terminal.

```

Haha, that's a lot of stuff. Go ahead and copy one of the SVGs that was output in your terminal and paste it [here](https://www.svgviewer.dev/) to see what you get.

You'll be able to see the SVG that was generated! Here's mine:

![Untitled](https://i.imgur.com/uS8SXYu.png)

**LETS GOOOOOOOO!!!!** We randomly generated this in our contract! If you take the other SVG you generated, you'll notice it's different as well. It's all being generated on the fly. YAY.

üë©‚Äçüíª Dynamically generate the metadata.
------------------

Now, we need to actually set the JSON metadata! First, we need some helper functions. Create a folder called `libraries` under `contracts`. In `libraries` create a file named `Base64.sol` and copy-paste the code from [here](https://gist.github.com/farzaa/f13f5d9bda13af68cc96b54851345832) into there. This file has some helper functions created by someone else to help us convert our SVG and JSON to Base64 in Solidity.

Okay, now for our updated contract.

**Same thing, I wrote out all the code and added comments [here](https://gist.github.com/farzaa/dc45da3eb91a41913767f3eb4d7830f1).**

Feel free to copy-paste some of these pieces and understand how it works after you run it :). I sometimes like doing this because I can see the code run and understand how it works after!!

Once I run the contract now here's what I get:

THIS IS EPIC.

WE JUST DYNAMICALLY GENERATED FULL NFTS. ON-CHAIN. THIS IS AN EPIC MOMENT.

If you take one of the `data:application/json;base64` blobs and drop it in your browser address bar, you'll see all the JSON metadata just like we had before. Except now, it's all done automatically and on our contract :).

üëÄ How tf does `finalTokenUri` work?
------------------

That big line with `string memory json = Base64.encode` may look pretty confusing, but, it only looks confusing because of all the quotation marks lol. All we're doing is we're base64 encoding the JSON metadata! But ‚Äî it's all **on-chain**. So, all that JSON will live on the contract itself.

We also dynamically add the `name` and the base64 encoded SVG as well!

Finally, we've got this `finalTokenUri` where we put it all together where we do:

```solidity
abi.encodePacked("data:application/json;base64,", json)
```

All that's happening here is we're putting it all together and adding that same old `data:application/json;base64,` we did before and then we append the base64 encoded json!!

üõ† Debugging the `finalTokenUri` content
------------------------
Now that you have your tokenURI setup, how do we know if it's actually correct? After all, this holds all our data for our NFT! You can use a cool tool like - [NFT Preview](https://nftpreview.0xdev.codes/) to see a quick preview of the image and the contents of the json without deploying it again and again on the opensea testnet. 

To make it easier, you can pass the `tokenURI` code as a query parameter like this,

```solidity
string memory finalTokenUri = string(
    abi.encodePacked("data:application/json;base64,", json)
);

console.log("\n--------------------");
console.log(
    string(
        abi.encodePacked(
            "https://nftpreview.0xdev.codes/?code=",
            finalTokenUri
        )
    )
);
console.log("--------------------\n");
```

üöÄ Deploy to Rinkeby
------------------

The coolest part is we can just re-deploy without changing our script using:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
```

Once we redeploy, you'll be able to see your NFTs on [https://testnets.opensea.io/](https://testnets.opensea.io/) once you search the newly deployed contract address. Again, **don't click enter**. OpenSea is weird so you'll need click the collection itself when it comes up.

Note: Remember to use `https://rinkeby.rarible.com/token/INSERT_DEPLOY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE:INSERT_TOKEN_ID_HERE` if you're using Rarible.

Contracts are **permanent**. So, whenever we re-deploy our contract we're actually creating a whole new collection.

You should be able to see the new collection on OpenSea or Rarible :)!

ü§ñ Allowing users to mint.
------------------

Epic ‚Äî we're now able to mint NFTs dynamically and we have this function `makeAnEpicNFT` that users can call. Lots of progress has been made!! Buuuuuut there's no way for random people to actually mint NFTs rn :(. 

All we need is a website that lets users mint an NFT themselves. 

So, let's build that :)!

üö®Progress report.
------------------------
If you got one, send a screenshot in #progress of your new dynamically generated NFT on OpenSea/Rarible :). Also -- if you haven't tweeted an image of your hilarious NFT collection yet now is the time to do so!! Remember to tag @_buildspace!!! We'll RT as many people as we can!
