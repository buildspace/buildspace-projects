## üëã Welcome

You've made it ‚Äî hell yeah! Welcome :). My name is Farza and I‚Äôll be your instructor. This project is for devs that want to get more into crypto tech. All you really need to know going into this: some terminal skills, some javascript, some react.js. You'll pick up the rest along the way.

Few action items for you before moving on:

1. **Connect your Discord in the project dashboard.** All the good stuff is going to be happening in a secret category in the Discord that you'll only have access to if you connect your Discord.
2. **Connect your Ethereum wallet in the project dashboard.** If you don't have a wallet that can interact with dApps, you can just install Metamask for free right now. Without a wallet, you can't do the project!
3. **Be sure to attend the kick-off**. If you miss it, no worries. It's not required to attend! The recording will be posted in Discord.

## üöÄ This is going to be awesome

I'm really excited to show you how to go from zero -> shipping your own NFTs.

What does "shipping" mean? Well, it means you'll actually make something and then deploy it to the internet for the world to see and use. You'll be able to show the final project off to your friends, potential employers, and even your dog! The best part is, your fellow classmates will be the first users for your project!!

This stuff is very new, there's a lot of hype around it, and it can be super difficult to understand the best way to learn it.

With this project, you're going to learn about crypto tech by actually writing code and just hopping into the good stuff. No B.S. We'll also go over theory and more in-depth concepts, but, it will all be structured around your project.

## üëÄ Earn a buildspace NFT by the end

When you reach the end of this project, you'll be able to earn an NFT.

You'll only be eligible for the NFT if you finish it within 60 days of signing up! So make sure you schedule time to finish, you got this!

**Once you finish the project, you'll get the NFT airdropped within 7 days**

Here's what it looks like:

Note: instead of "Alkes", your NFT would say the name of your cohort ‚Äî each cohort is named after a star! Also, the # at the bottom right will be the # minted which depends on when you claim the NFT.


## üõ† What we're building

You know those websites where people are making millions of dollars where users can come and "mint" an NFT? We're building that.

Your project will let users connect their Ethereum wallet, and mint an NFT to their wallet so they actually own it. They'll even be able to re-sell the NFT on OpenSea. The NFT itself can be customized to whatever you want.

They'll even show up on OpenSea :).

You'll be able to customize the NFT itself as much as you want at the end and do whatever you want.

But, the NFTs I'll be going over in these guides are NFTs that are basically a square box with a randomly generated three-word combination at the center. Why? Because I think it's funny lol. Some of these three-word combos are really fkin funny.

Coolest part? Everything will be happening *on-chain*. This means all the NFT data will live on the blockchain itself. If that doesn't make sense, don't worry just yet ‚Äî it will :)!


## ü§ö How to get help

When you have a question, hit up the proper channel for the project.

This project is broken up into 4 sections. You can see what section you're on by checking out the progress bar at the very top of the page. So, for example, if you're stuck on some part of Section 3, you'd hit up `#section-3-help` in the Discord.


## üì∫ Where does the Live Kick-Off Happen?

They will be happening on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/buildspace). Be sure to make an account on Twitch ahead of time so you'll be able to chat during the stream!

## ü§ò See an issue? Want to improve something? Fix it yourself ;)

**[All this content is completely open-source](https://github.com/buildspace/buildspace-projects)**. If you see an issue, typo, etc ‚Äî you can fix it yourself easily and make a PR! If you need help doing this, DM `@alec` in the Discord :). 

Let's get you some open-source rep!!

At the very least, drop a ‚≠ê on the repo if you're feeling fancy!


## üö®Curious about working in web3?

We're partnered with a bunch of awesome web3 companies that want to hire people from the buildspace network. We got companies like OpenSea, Edge and Node, and Chainlink as partners. **Even if you're just curious**, click "Work in Web3" on the side-bar, fill out the form real quick, and check out the opportunities!!

Worst case scenario, you get to talk to some really cool people in web3 :).
