### **👋 Welcome.**

You've made it — hell yeah! Welcome :). My name is [Farza](https://twitter.com/FarzaTV) and I’m just the guy who will be chatting with yah here. BTW -- massive shoutout to [Nacho lacovino](https://twitter.com/nachoiacovino) and [Jonas](https://twitter.com/jnsdls) for helping us write these docs. 

This project is for devs that want to better understand what the heck a DAO is by just building one themselves. 

All you really need to know going into this is **some terminal skills, some javascript, and some React.js**. You'll pick up the rest along the way. No Solidity needed. We'll be using this fancy tool called [thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/) which lets us work with smart contracts using just javascript. 

Few action items for you before moving on:

1. **Connect your Discord in the project dashboard.** All the good stuff is going to be happening in a secret category in the Discord that you'll only have access to once you connect your Discord.
2. **Connect your Ethereum wallet in the project dashboard.** We'll airdrop you an NFT once you finish this, and if you don't have a wallet connected we won't be able to airdrop it to you! By the way - you won't need to pay any gas fees, we'll cover that for you!
3. **Be sure to attend the live kick-off**. If you miss it, no worries. It's not required to attend!

### **🤔 What are we building?**
Check out a quick video I made covering the project here:

### **💎 Earning an NFT.**

When you reach the end of this project, you'll earn an NFT. Here's what it looks like:

**Note: Each cohort is named after a star (ex. [Alkes](https://www.star-facts.com/alkes/), [Beid](https://www.universeguide.com/star/19587/beid), etc)! Also, the # on the back will be the # minted which depends on when you finish! Each NFT is unique.** 

### **🤚 How to get help.**

When you have a question, hit up the proper channel for the project.

This project is broken up into 4 sections. You can see what section you're on by checking out the progress bar at the very top of the page in your buildspace dashboard. So, for example, if you're stuck on some part of Section 3, you'd hit up `#section-3-help` in the Discord. If you're part of multiple projects, be sure to ask your questions in the right project category!

**When you need help w/ something please feel free to ping the thirdweb team directly.**

### **🤘 See an issue? Want to improve something? Fix it yourself ;).**

**[All this content is completely open-source](https://github.com/buildspace/buildspace-projects)**. If you see an issue, typo, etc — you can fix it yourself easily and make a PR! If you need help doing this, DM `@alec` in the Discord :).

At the very least, drop a ⭐ on the repo if you're feeling fancy!

Let's get you some open-source rep!!!

### 👀 **Curious about working in web3?**

**People seem to think web3 just needs people who can code smart contracts or write code that interfaces w/ the blockchain. Not true.**

There is so much work to do and most of the work doesn't even have to do w/ smart contracts lol. Being an engineer in web3 just means you take your web2 skills and apply them to web3.

Web3 also desperately needs designers, product managers, marketers, and more.

**We're partnered with a bunch of awesome web3 companies that want to hire people from the buildspace network.**

We got companies like OpenSea, Edge and Node, and Chainlink as partners. **Even if you're just curious**, click "Work in Web3" on the side-bar, fill out the form real quick, and check out the opportunities!!

Worst case scenario, you get to talk to some really cool people in web3.

Just do it really quick right now :).

### 🚨 Progress Report

*Please do this else Farza will be sad :(*

Hey! Go ahead and say gm in `#gm-only` on Discord. This is very important. Extremely important.

If you don't do this then all of humanity will collectively jump and disrupt the Earth's orbit causing it to collide with Venus.

**BTW -- if you want to make a tweet telling the world that you're building your own DAO today and tag [@_buildspace](https://twitter.com/_buildspace)! I always say this, but 1) that tweet could inspire someone else to join web3 and 2) it supports us!**
