### 👋 Welcome

You've made it — hell yeah! Welcome :). My name is [Farza](https://twitter.com/FarzaTV) and I’m just the guy who will be chatting with yah here. BTW -- massive shoutout to [Nacho Iacovino](https://twitter.com/nachoiacovino) and [Jonas](https://twitter.com/jnsdls) for helping us write these docs.

This project is for devs that want to better understand what the heck a DAO is by just building one themselves.

All you really need to know going into this is **some terminal skills, some JavaScript, and some React.js**. You'll pick up the rest along the way. No Solidity needed. We'll be using this fancy tool called [thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/?utm_source=buildspace) which lets us work with smart contracts using just JavaScript.

Few action items for you before moving on:

1. **Connect your Discord in the project dashboard.** All the good stuff is going to be happening in a secret category in the Discord that you'll only have access to once you connect your Discord.
2. **Connect your Ethereum wallet in the project dashboard.** We'll airdrop you an NFT once you finish this, and if you don't have a wallet connected we won't be able to airdrop it to you! By the way - you won't need to pay any gas fees, we'll cover that for you!
3. **Be sure to attend the live kick-off**. If you miss it, no worries. It's not required to attend!

### 🤔 What are we building?

Check out a quick video I made covering the project here:

### 💎 Earning an NFT

When you reach the end of this project, you'll be able to mint an NFT.

Here's what it looks like:

**Note: Please reach out to Alec(alec#8853), CodePerfect(CodePerfect#6638) or Raza(TooManyBugs#3359) if you encounter any issues with claiming your NFTs**

### 🤚 How to get help

When you have a question, hit up the proper channel for the project.

This project is broken up into 4 sections. You can see what section you're on by checking out the progress bar at the very top of the page in your buildspace dashboard. So, for example, if you're stuck on some part of Section 3, you'd hit up `#section-3-help` in the Discord. If you're part of multiple projects, be sure to ask your questions in the right project category!

**When you need help w/ something please feel free to ping the thirdweb team directly.**

### 🚨 Progress Report

_Please do this else Farza will be sad :(_

Hey! Go ahead and say gm in `#gm-only` on Discord. This is very important. Extremely important.

If you don't do this then all of humanity will collectively jump and disrupt the Earth's orbit causing it to collide with Venus.

**BTW -- if you want to make a tweet telling the world that you're building your own DAO today and tag [@_buildspace](https://twitter.com/_buildspace)! I always say this, but 1) that tweet could inspire someone else to join web3 and 2) it supports us!**
