## 👻 How does a DAO work?

What's a DAO? Hmmm.

There are so many different definitions and explanations of what a DAO is. I just googled it and it says, "A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an entity with no central leadership. Decisions get made from the bottom-up, governed by a community organized around a specific set of rules enforced on a blockchain".

I feel like even after reading this, I still don’t understand what the heck a DAO is. Simply put, a DAO is a community of people with a shared bank account. Decisions around how that bank account is used are made by voting on different proposals that members create. When a proposal gets enough votes, it is executed on-chain!

## 💰 Y-Combinator

[Y-Combinator (YC)](https://www.ycombinator.com/) is a famous startup accelerator. They have a massive bank account funded by various people + profits from startups that have exited. The "YC Partners" are a group of people that decide what companies to accept into the program and invest in. The partners have invested in various companies that have exploded in value:

YC has an extremely centralized approach where a small # of key people decide who to invest in — which isn't a bad thing! I want to stress that just because something is centralized **doesn't mean it's bad lol.**

## 🤠 Y-Combinator as a DAO

Let's imagine YC as a DAO, We'll call it YCDAO.

Investors could put money into YCDAO and get back $YCDAO token. The money would live in a "treasury" on-chain that anyone would be able to see. The treasury is just the shared bank account.

For example, if I put in $5 into YC DAO I may get back 5 $YCDAO token. If I put in $100,000 I may get back 100,000 $YCDAO token. It depends on how the creators set up the rules.

Cool, so now I have some $YCDAO. YCDAO members with the token can now vote on proposals for different companies applying to YCDAO and decide whether or not to invest in them.

"Voting Power" would depend on how it is initially set up.

For example, 1 $YCDAO token could equal one vote. But maybe you think this isn't fair because it means ultra-rich people would rule the organization with their votes. That's fine, you can change the rule to say: "Everyone gets one vote, regardless of how many tokens they own". It's really up to the DAOs creators to think through what's best for members. But, I just want you to know **voting power formulas can be custom!** That's the absolute beauty of a DAO 🌸.

Let's say 90% of people in YCDAO voted "Yes" to invest in DogDAO —  a DAO for dog owners. Great. That proposal would automatically be executed on-chain. YCDAO would automatically send the funds to DogDAO's treasury. In exchange, DogDAO would automatically send $DOG to YCDAO's treasury. Bam. Investment complete.

Let's say DogDAO takes off and becomes wildly profitable by selling dog training lessons or something. That means that the $DOG token that YCDAO owns would have increased in value and YCDAO would make a profit by selling the token if they wanted. $YCDAO token itself would also go up in value because YCDAO's treasury has increased in value thanks to a fantastic investment.

What's magical here is you don't need to trust a central entity to make sure the investment goes through. It's all automatic and revolves around rules that the DAO sets when it is created.

You definitely should read through that example a few times! I wanted to lay out something concrete for you to wrap your head around. YCDAO isn't real of course, but there are quite a few people pursuing the model. [Here](https://www.hyperscalefund.com/) is an example.

**Remember, at the end of the day a DAO is just a group of strangers with a shared bank account that vote on how to use that bank account.**

If you still don't get it, don't worry. **Let's hop into the code and just build one ourselves :).**

### 🚨 Progress Report

*Please do this else Farza will be sad :(*

Hey! In `#progress` let us all know what kinda DAO you’ll be building for this project. The funnier, the better. If you don’t know yet, just throw something out there! Examples:

**AnimeDAO** — a community of anime lovers that receive $ANIME whenever they interact w/ the community and talk about anime.

**PizzaDAO** — a charity DAO focused around giving away pizza. Members can donate ETH to the charity and receive $PIZZA in return. 

**FarzaDAO** — a DAO for fans of Farza that receive $FARZA whenever they tweet nice things about Farza.

**ArtistDAO** — a DAO of artists that run events and workshops for artists of all levels. Whenever a member runs an event or workshop, they receive $ARTIST.

**PakistanDAO** — a DAO for members of the Pakistani startup community to support each other. Members earn $PAKISTAN whenever they provide value to other founders, for example by giving them advice, beta-testing their products, or supporting them on social media. 

Please don’t copy my exact examples heh. Get creative. **I really want you to think hard about something that makes you smile or something your friends would find funny lol.**
