### 😍 Hello, DAO Master

You’ve done it. You made it to the end. I’m proud af. This is you rn:

DAOs are this really new, mystical thing that a lot of people are talking about. But, you did more than just talk about them — you actually made one!! In classic buildspace style, you dove into this really deep and complex topic by just hopping right into the code. Congrats my friend!

A quick review here, you just:

✅ deployed your own custom ERC-20 token.

✅ deployed your own ERC-1155 NFT people can mint to join your DAO.

✅ deployed your own governance contract + treasury.

✅ built a dapp that lets people connect their wallet, get an NFT, see a DAO Dashboard where they can see other members + actually vote on proposals that are executed directly by your governance contract.

I know it’s hard to believe, but you created a full-fledged DAO. I hope at the very least this project gave you a grasp on what a DAO is and how one works. There is of course more to a DAO than what we covered in this project here, stuff like tokenomics, running an actual community, planning your DAOs roadmap, etc — these are all things we haven't covered , but hey, I’m sure you’ll figure it out ;).

### 🌈 Before you head out

Go to **#showcase** in Discord and drop us a link to your final product that we can mess around with. If you didn’t use Replit, be sure to deploy with something like Vercel or Netlify. **You made it this far, you better deploy your site lol.**

Also, you should totally tweet out your final project and show the world your epic creation! What you did wasn't easy by any means. Maybe even make a little video showing off your project and attach that to the tweet. Make your tweet look pretty and show off!!

And if you feel up to it, tag [@_buildspace](https://twitter.com/_buildspace) :). **It gives us a ton of motivation whenever we see people ship their projects.** Plus, you can inspire someone else to get into web3.

Give us that dopamine hit pls.

Lastly, what would also be awesome is if you told us in #feedback how you liked this project and the structure of the project. What did you love most about buildspace? What sucked? What would like us to change for future projects? Your feedback would be awesome!

See yah around!!!
