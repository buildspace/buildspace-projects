### â›“Â Specify your chain and wallet type

So, in order for our website to talk to the blockchain, we need to somehow connect our wallet to it. Once we connect our wallet to our website, our website will have permission to call smart contracts on our behalf.Â **Remember, it's just like authenticating into a website.**

You may have built "Connect to Wallet" buttons in the past! This time, we'll be using thirdwebâ€™s front-end SDK which makes it crazy easy.

Head over to `src/index.js` in your React App and add the following code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';

// Import thirdweb provider and Rinkeby ChainId
import { ChainId, ThirdwebProvider } from '@thirdweb-dev/react';

// This is the chainId your dApp will work on.
const activeChainId = ChainId.Rinkeby;

// Wrap your app with the thirdweb provider
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ThirdwebProvider desiredChainId={activeChainId}>
      <App />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
);
```

Pretty simple. We're importing thirdweb and then specifying the `chainId` of the chain we're working on, which is Rinkeby!.

Then we're wrapping everything with `<ThirdwebProvider>`, this provider holds the user's authenticated wallet data (if they've connected to our website before) and passes it over to `App`.

*Note: If you've worked on dapps before, make sure you disconnect your wallet from [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) on Metamask if you have ever connected it before.*

### ðŸŒŸÂ Add Connect to Wallet

If you head over to your web app, you'll see a blank purple page. Let's add some basic copy + a button to let users connect their wallet.

Head over to `App.jsx`. Add the following code.

```jsx
import { useAddress, useMetamask } from '@thirdweb-dev/react';

const App = () => {
  // Use the hooks thirdweb give us.
  const address = useAddress();
  const connectWithMetamask = useMetamask();
  console.log("ðŸ‘‹ Address:", address);

  // This is the case where the user hasn't connected their wallet
  // to your web app. Let them call connectWallet.
  if (!address) {
    return (
      <div className="landing">
        <h1>Welcome to NarutoDAO</h1>
        <button onClick={connectWithMetamask} className="btn-hero">
          Connect your wallet
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }

  // This is the case where we have the user's address
  // which means they've connected their wallet to our site!
  return (
    <div className="landing">
      <h1>ðŸ‘€ wallet connected, now what!</h1>
    </div>);
}

export default App;
```

Pretty easy! BTW -- at this point make sure your web app is running using `npm start` if you're working locally.

Now, when you go to your web app and click connect to wallet, you'll see it pops Metamask! After you authorize your wallet, you'll see this screen:

Boom. And if you go to your console, you'll see it prints out your public address. If you refresh your page here, you'll see our wallet connection sticks around as well.

If you've built a connect to wallet in the past, you'll notice how it is way easier w/ thirdweb's client SDK since it handles common edge cases for you (ex. maintaining the state of a user's wallet in a variable). 

BTW â€” here I do `<h1>Welcome to NarutoDAO</h1>`, please make this your own. Donâ€™t copy me! This is your DAO!

*Note: feel free to [disconnect your website](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059535551-Disconnect-wallet-from-Dapp) from Metamask as well if you want to test the case where a user hasn't connected their wallet.* 

### ðŸš¨ Progress Report

*Please do this else Farza will be sad :(*

Post a screenshot in `#progress` showing your DAOâ€™s main welcome screen with the connect to wallet button. It better not say NarutoDAO!
