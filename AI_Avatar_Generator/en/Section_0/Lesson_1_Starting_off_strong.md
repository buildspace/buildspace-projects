### **What you need to know to build this.**
You don’t need to know *that* much to build this thing. I’ll give you the things you need to actually make this thing and even go beyond that.

**But, you should at least know how to code in one language and how to use the command line. If you know JS and React that helps a lot as well.**

- If you don’t know how to code in any language at all, my recommendation is you go [here](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript) first. **Our specialty at buildspace isn’t teaching people to code from scratch**, there are much better platforms for that.
- If you know how to code a *little* but aren’t that confident, see how far you get in this build! If you have issues or see obvious gaps in your knowledge, don’t worry. We’ve have a massive Discord community of builders that will be with you every step of the way!
- If you know how to code in any language, but have never used React -- you’ll be just fine. If you end up really struggling with React, you can learn it [here](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact).
- If you’re a pro I better see you at the end with a really fucking cool product. Inspire the rest of us!

### 💎 Earning an NFT

When you reach the end of this project, you'll be able to mint an NFT.

**Note: Please reach out to Alec(alec#8853), CodePerfect(CodePerfect#6638) or Raza(TooManyBugs#3359) if you encounter any issues with claiming your NFTs**

### **Build in public.**

Through this build, I’ll give you certain moments where you can share what you’re building + give you pre-built messages to inspire you to tell the world about what you're building.

There is zero harm in **building in public —** believe it or not, almost all the people I’ve met have helped me continue building great things because I tweeted randomly about what I was building lol.

### **What happens at the end?**

At the end of every build at buildspace, you get the ability to claim a unique NFT. Use this NFT to unlock **REALLY** cool perks around epic AI/ML platforms to make your final ship that much better.

This NFT gives you access to a few secret powers:

1. **It gets you access to alumni channels on our Discord,** which is where most of the more interesting discussions happen. Way less noise and way higher value -- it’s where all the true shippers are.
2. **A lot of magic when building happens IRL**. That’s why we’re building out IRL hubs around the world for our top alumni to visit/build from whenever they want. The more NFTs you hold, the better chance you have of getting access. **Our first IRL hub opens in SF on March 1, 2023.**
3. **You’ll get accepted instantly to [Nights & Weekends](https://buildspace.so/nights-and-weekends)** if you have the NFT. N&W is kinda like an accelerator we run -- build out any idea you want over 6-weeks, come out to San Francisco for 3-days to build IRL, and present your work at demo day in front of thousands. N&W alumni have gone on to raise millions of dollars.

### Please do this or Raza will be sad.
In `#sd-general` — tell the world why you’re curious about doing this stuff. It’d be cool to understand why you’re curious about this stuff, what you’re trying to build, what inspired you to get into this, etc.

Also, this is a cool way to make some friends — the magical thing about buildspace is that over **140,000 people are in the Discord** and you never know who may see your message, resonate with what you say, and reach out to you!
