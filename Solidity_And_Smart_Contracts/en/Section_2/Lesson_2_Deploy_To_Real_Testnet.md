## üì§ Setting up to deploy to the blockchain

Go ahead and close the terminal with your local blockchain network running which is where you ran `npx hardhat node`. We won't need it anymore ;). I mainly just wanted to show you how deploying works locally.

Now we're going to be doing the real deal, deploying to the actual blockchain.

Go ahead and make an account with QuickNode [here](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=buildspace&utm_campaign=generic&utm_content=sign-up&utm_medium=buildspace).

Sorry for having you make so many accounts, but, this ecosystem is complex and we want to take advantage of the awesome tools out there. What QuickNode does is it gives us a simple way to deploy to the real Ethereum blockchain.

## üí≥ Transactions

So, when we want to perform an action on the Ethereum blockchain we call it a *transaction*. For example, sending someone ETH is a transaction. Doing something that updates a variable in our contract is also considered a transaction.

So when we call `wave` and it does `totalWaves += 1`, that's a transaction!¬†**Deploying a smart contract is also a transaction.**

Remember, the blockchain has no owner. It's just a bunch of computers around the world run by **miners** that have a copy of the blockchain.

When we deploy our contract,¬†we need to tell **all those** miners, "hey, this is a new smart contract, please add my smart contract to the blockchain and then tell everyone else about it as well".

This is where [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=buildspace&utm_campaign=generic&utm_content=sign-up&utm_medium=buildspace) comes in.

QuickNode essentially helps us broadcast our contract creation transaction so that it can be picked up by miners as quickly as possible. Once the transaction is mined, it is then broadcasted to the blockchain as a legit transaction. From there, everyone updates their copy of the blockchain.

This is complicated. And, don't worry if you don't fully understand it. As you write more code and actually build this app, it'll naturally make more sense.¬†

So, make an account with QuickNode [here](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=buildspace&utm_campaign=generic&utm_content=sign-up&utm_medium=buildspace).

## üï∏Ô∏è Testnets

We're not going to be deploying to the "Ethereum mainnet" until the very end. Why? Because it costs real $ and it's not worth messing up! We're going to start with a "testnet" which is a clone of "mainnet" but it uses fake $ so we can test stuff out as much as we want. But, it's important to know that testnets are run by actual miners and mimic real-world scenarios.

This is awesome because we can test our application in a real-world scenario where we're actually going to:

1\. Broadcast our transaction

2\. Wait for it to be picked up by actual miners

3\. Wait for it to be mined

4\. Wait for it to be broadcasted back to the blockchain telling all the other miners to update their copies

So, you'll be doing all this within the next few lessons :).

## ü§ë Getting some fake $

There are a few testnets out there and the one we'll be using is called "Goerli" which is run by the Ethereum foundation.

In order to deploy to Goerli, we need fake ether. Why? Because if you were deploying to the actual Ethereum mainnet, you'd use real money! So, testnets copy how mainnet works, only difference is no real money is involved.

In order to get fake ETH, we have to ask the network for some. **This fake ETH will only work on this specific testnet.** You can grab some fake ETH for Goerli through a faucet. Make sure that your MetaMask wallet is set to the "Goerli Test Network" before using faucet.

For MyCrypto, you'll need to connect your wallet, make an account, and then click that same link again to request funds. For the official Goerli faucet, you should log into your Alchemy account to receive 2x the amount.

| Name             | Link                                  | Amount          | Time         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| Chainlink        | https://faucets.chain.link/goerli     | 0.1             | None         |
| Official Goerli  | https://goerlifaucet.com              | 0.25            | 24 hrs       |
| MyCrypto         | https://app.mycrypto.com/faucet       | 0.01            | None         |


## üôÉ Having trouble getting Testnet ETH?

If the above doesn't work, use the `/faucet` command in the #faucet-request channel and our bot will send you some! If you want some more, send your public wallet address and drop a funny gif. Either me, or someone from the project will send you some fake ETH as soon as they can. The funnier the gif, the faster you will get sent fake ETH LOL.

## üìà Deploy to Goerli testnet

We'll need to change our `hardhat.config.js` file. You can find this in the root directory of your smart contract project.

```javascript
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");

// This is a sample Hardhat task. To learn how to create your own go to
// https://hardhat.org/guides/create-task.html
task("accounts", "Prints the list of accounts", async (taskArgs, hre) => {
    const accounts = await hre.ethers.getSigners();

    for (const account of accounts) {
        console.log(account.address);
    }
});

// You need to export an object to set up your config
// Go to https://hardhat.org/config/ to learn more

/**
 * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
 */
module.exports = {
    solidity: "0.8.17",
    networks: {
      goerli: {
        url: "YOUR_QUICKNODE_API_URL",
        accounts: ["YOUR_PRIVATE_GOERLI_ACCOUNT_KEY"]
      },
    },
};
```

**Note: DON'T COMMIT THIS FILE TO GITHUB. IT HAS YOUR PRIVATE KEY. YOU WILL GET HACKED + ROBBED. THIS PRIVATE KEY IS THE SAME AS YOUR MAINNET PRIVATE KEY.** 

**If uploading to Github or using git version control in general it is good practice to protect yourself from uploading secrect keys to somewhere you don't want them. First of all the best way is to not upload your hardhat config file by adding it to .gitignore.**

Another way of protecting yourself and keeping `hardhat.config.js` secure is to use dotenv. Install it with:

```bash
npm install --save dotenv
```

Now we can update hardhat.config.js to use dotenv:

```javascript
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
// Import and configure dotenv
require("dotenv").config();

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.17",
  networks: {
    goerli: {
      // This value will be replaced on runtime
      url: process.env.STAGING_QUICKNODE_KEY,
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
    mainnet: {
      url: process.env.PROD_QUICKNODE_KEY,
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
  },
};
```

In the root project folder, create a `.env` file and add your secrets. It should look like this:

```javascript
STAGING_QUICKNODE_KEY=REPLACE_WITH_ACTUAL_QUICKNODE_URL     // Goerli Quicknode
PROD_QUICKNODE_KEY=BLAHBLAH                                 // Mainnet Quicknode
PRIVATE_KEY=BLAHBLAH
```
Finally, add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file so Git ignores it and your secrets don't leave your machine! If you're confused by any of this, just watch a YouTube video on it, it's easy stuff!

Next, grab your API URL from the QuickNode dashboard and paste that in. Then, you'll need your¬†**private** Goerli key (not your public address!) which you can grab from metamask and paste that in there as well.

**Note: Accessing your private key can be done by opening MetaMask, change the network to "Goerli Test Network" and then click the three dots and select "Account Details" > "Export Private Key"**

Why do you need to use your private key? Because in order to perform a transaction like deploying a contract, you need to "login" to the blockchain. And, your username is your public address and your password is your private key. It's kinda like logging into AWS or GCP to deploy.

Once you've got your config setup we're set to deploy with the deploy script we wrote earlier.

Run this command from the root directory of `my-wave-portal`. Notice all we do is change it from `localhost` to `goerli`.

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Deployed!¬†

Here's my output:

```bash
Deploying contracts with the account: 0xF79A3bb8d5b93686c4068E2A97eAeC5fE4843E7D
Account balance: 3198297774605223721
WavePortal address: 0xd5f08a0ae197482FA808cE84E00E97d940dBD26E
```

Copy that address of the deployed contract in the last line and save it somewhere. Don't lose it! You'll need it for the frontend later :). Yours will be different from mine.

**You just deployed your contract. WOOOOOOOOO.**

You can actually take that address and then paste it into Etherscan [here](https://goerli.etherscan.io/). Etherscan is a place that just shows us the state of the blockchain and helps us see where our transaction is at. You should see your transaction here :). It may take a minute to show up!

For example, [here's](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x957fe7381be45A31967F1EcfAc6Ff001D8AF8D6c) mine!

## üö® Before you click "Next Lesson"

**YOU JUST DID A LOT.**


It's a big deal that you got this far. You created and deployed something to the actual blockchain. **Holy shit**. **I'm proud of you.**

You're now someone who is actually "doing" the thing that mostly everyone else is just "talking" about.

We've seen that the best builders have made it a habit to "build in public". All this means is sharing a few learnings about the milestone they've just hit!

This is a good time to tweet out that you're learning about Solidity and just deployed your first program to the testnet. Inspire others to join web3!

You're a step closer to mastering the arts of web3.

KEEP GOING :).
