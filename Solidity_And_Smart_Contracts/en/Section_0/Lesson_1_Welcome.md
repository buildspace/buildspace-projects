üëã Welcome
----------------------------------

You've made it ‚Äî hell yeah! Welcome :). My name is Farza and I‚Äôll be your instructor. This project is for devs that want to get more into crypto tech. All you really need to know going into this: some terminal skills, some javascript, some react.js. You'll pick up the rest along the way.

A few action items for you before moving on:

1. **Connect your Discord in the project dashboard.** All the good stuff is going to be happening in a secret category in the Discord that you'll only have access to if you connect your Discord.
2. **Connect your Ethereum wallet in the project dashboard.** If you don't have a wallet that can interact with dApps, you can just install Metamask for free right now. Without a wallet, you can't do the project!
3. **Be sure to attend the kick-off**. If you miss it, no worries. It's not required! You'll get an email with the recording. I'll also post the recording in the Discord.


üöÄ This is going to be awesome
----------------------------------

I'm really excited to show you how to go from zero -> shipping your own web3 app + Ethereum smart contract.

What does "shipping" mean? Well, it means you'll actually make something and then deploy it to the internet for the world to see and use. You'll be able to show the final project off to your friends, potential employers, and even your dog! The best part is, your fellow classmates will be the first users for your project!!

This stuff is very new, there's a lot of hype around it, and it can be super difficult to understand the best way to learn it.

With this project, you're going to learn about crypto tech by actually writing code and just hopping into the good stuff. No B.S. We'll also go over theory and more in-depth concepts, but, it will all be structured around your project.

Checkout a little intro video I made about this project below!

üëÄ Earn a buildspace NFT by the end.
-------------------

When you reach the end of this project, you'll be able to earn an NFT.

**We'll airdrop an NFT to your connected wallet if you finish the project within 7-days of the kick-off.**

Note: instead of "Capella", yours would say name of your cohort ‚Äî each cohort is named after a star! Also, the # at the bottom right will be the # minted which depends on when you claim the NFT.


üõ† What will you be building?
-----------------------------

You'll be building a website that I'll be calling the WavePortal --- it'll be a place where anyone on the internet can learn a little about who you are and send you a üëã + a message and have that data saved on the blockchain through an Ethereum smart contract. (A smart contract is basically code that lives on the blockchain you can read and write from, we'll talk about this more in a bit).

You'll be writing + deploying the smart contract and you'll also be building the website that will let people actually connect their wallets and interact with your smart contract.

We're going to make this a little spicy as well. Basically, when someone waves at you there is a random chance they can win a small amount of ETH from your site :).

You'll be able to customize the website as much as you want. For example:
- Maybe instead of a üëã you want people to send you a üí©.
- Perhaps instead of a plain old message, you want them to send you a Spotify link and create a place where anyone can send you awesome music and have it saved.
- You can change the smart contract to recognize when one of your friends is waving at you (based on their Ethereum wallet address) and then take them to a page where they get Rick Roll'd.

You can do whatever you want :).

By the end, you'll have a site you can show off and actually have people use. Your fellow classmates will be your first users!


üì∫ Where does the Live Kick-Off Happen?
---------------------------------------

They'll be happening at <https://www.twitch.tv/buildspace>. Be sure to make an account on Twitch ahead of time so you'll be able to chat during the stream!


ü§ö How to get help.
---------------------------------------

When you have a question, hit up the proper channel for the project.

This project is broken up into 4 sections. You can see what section you're on by checking out the progress bar at the very top of the page. So, for example, if you're stuck on some part of Section 3, you'd hit up `#section-3-help` in the Discord. If you're part of multiple projects, be sure to ask your questions in the right project category!


ü§ò See an issue? Want to improve something? Fix it yourself ;).
---------------------------------------

**[All this content is completely open-source](https://github.com/buildspace/buildspace-projects)**. If you see an issue, typo, etc ‚Äî you can fix it yourself easily and make a PR! If you need help doing this, DM `@alec` in the Discord :). 

Let's get you some open-source rep!!!

At the very least, drop a ‚≠ê on the repo if you're feeling fancy!


üö®Curious about working in web3?
-------------------

We're partnered with a bunch of awesome web3 companies that want to hire people from the buildspace network. We got companies like OpenSea, Edge and Node, and Chainlink as partners. **Even if you're just curious**, click "Work in Web3" on the side-bar, fill out the form real quick, and check out the opportunities!!

Worst case scenario, you get to talk to some really cool people in web3 :).
