👋 Welcome
----------------------------------

You've made it — hell yeah! Welcome :). My name is Farza and I’ll be your instructor. This project is for devs that want to get more into crypto tech. All you really need to know going into this: some terminal skills, some javascript, some react.js. You'll pick up the rest along the way.

A few action items for you before moving on:

1. **Connect your Discord in the course dashboard.** All the good stuff is going to be happening in a secret category in the Discord that you'll only have access to if you connect your Discord.
2. **Connect your Ethereum wallet in the course dashboard.** If you don't have a wallet that can interact with dApps, you can just install Metamask for free right now. Without a wallet, you can't do the project!
3. **Be sure to attend the kick-off**. If you miss it, no worries. It's not required! You'll get an email with the recording. I'll also post the recording in the Discord.


🚀 This is going to be awesome
----------------------------------

I'm really excited to show you how to go from zero -> shipping your own web3 app + Ethereum smart contract.

What does "shipping" mean? Well, it means you'll actually make something and then deploy it to the internet for the world to see and use. You'll be able to show the final project off to your friends, potential employers, and even your dog! The best part is, your fellow classmates will be the first users for your project!!

This stuff is very new, there's a lot of hype around it, and it can be super difficult to understand the best way to learn it.

With this project, you're going to learn about crypto tech by actually writing code and just hopping into the good stuff. No B.S. We'll also go over theory and more in-depth concepts, but, it will all be structured around your project.

Here's a little [intro video I made about the project](https://www.loom.com/share/8746b43760c74c6791ba17af9940ea8e)!


🏠 How is this all structured?
------------------------------

This project usually takes people like 5-10 hours total. Some people knock it out within the same day it starts, others take a few days!

The "kick-off" is the only live thing in this project and it'll be recorded. The rest of the project is made up of these async lessons.

After that, we'll be hosting "co-working sessions" and will email you days I'm doing them.

Basically, co-working sessions at buildspace are specific times for you to work on your project for 1-hour. It's pretty cool. Everyone joins the #cowork-sesh voice channel at a scheduled time (all muted by default), works individually on their projects, and chills with their classmates in a virtual space. We also play some chill lofi beats!

During the session, you'll also be able to ask questions in #cowork-chat and I'll be there answering them. Again, everyone's muted. We just talk in text-chat so people can focus! :)

👀 Earn a _buildspace NFT by the end
------------------------------

When you reach the end of this project, you'll be able to earn an NFT.

**You can only claim an NFT if you finish the project within 7-days of the kick-off. After that, you won't be able to claim it!**

This NFT not only looks cool, but it will also get you access to secret opportunities in crypto such as — full-time work, internships, and contract work. This initiative is a work in progress :).

Note: instead of "Capella", yours would have the name of your cohort and every cohort is named after a star! Also, the # at the bottom right will be the # minted which depends on when you claim the NFT. Also -- the name of the project at the top left would be different!

To claim the NFT, you'll need to pay [gas fees](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/) which are fees that Ethereum charges you to perform transactions on the network. Gas fees to redeem the NFT vary. I recommend transferring around $30 - $50 worth of ETH over to your wallet.

If you don't know how to do this, don't worry about it for now -- not required.

*Note: The project itself doesn't require you to have any real money at all! We'll still be deploying to the blockchain using something special Ethereum provides us called a "testnet".*


🛠 What will you be building?
-----------------------------

You'll be building a website that I'll be calling the WavePortal --- it'll be a place where anyone on the internet can learn a little about who you are and send you a 👋 + a message and have that data saved on the blockchain through an Ethereum smart contract. (A smart contract is basically code that lives on the blockchain you can read and write from, we'll talk about this more in a bit).

You'll be writing + deploying the smart contract and you'll also be building the website that will let people actually connect their wallets and interact with your smart contract.

We're going to make this a little spicy as well. Basically, when someone waves at you there is a random chance they can win a small amount of ETH from your site :).

You'll be able to customize the website as much as you want. For example:
- Maybe instead of a 👋 you want people to send you a 💩.
- Perhaps instead of a plain old message, you want them to send you a Spotify link and create a place where anyone can send you awesome music and have it saved.
- You can change the smart contract to recognize when one of your friends is waving at you (based on their Ethereum wallet address) and then take them to a page where they get Rick Roll'd.

You can do whatever you want :).

By the end, you'll have a site you can show off and actually have people use. Your fellow classmates will be your first users!


📺 Where does the Live Kick-Off Happen?
---------------------------------------

They'll be happening at <https://www.twitch.tv/buildspace>. Be sure to make an account on Twitch ahead of time so you'll be able to chat during the stream!


🤚 How to get help.
---------------------------------------

When you have a question, hit up the proper channel for the project.

This project is broken up into 4 sections. You can see what section you're on by checking out the progress bar at the very top of the page. So, for example, if you're stuck on some part of Section 3, you'd hit up `#section-3-help` in the Discord. If you're part of multiple projects, we sure to ask your questions in the right project category!

Another great time to ask is during co-working sessions which are guaranteed times TAs will be online. During coworking sessions, you can ask questions in `#cowork-chat` on the Discord.

Let's get you some open-source rep!!!


🚨 Optional -- wanna work in crypto?
--------------------------------------------

We're partnered with a bunch of dope companies. We'll help you get hired in crypto. Even if you're just curious, fill out the form!! What's the worst that can happen -- you get connected to some dope crypto companies!?
