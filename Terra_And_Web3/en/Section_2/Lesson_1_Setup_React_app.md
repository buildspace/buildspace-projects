### üèÅ Getting started with React.js
Now this is where the fun REALLY starts. Writing and deploying your smart contract is one thing, but building a portal where anyone in the world can interact with the blockchain is just pure magic ‚ú®.

We are going to be using React.js to build our web app. If you are already familiar with React, this will be a breeze. If you haven't done much React, don't worry! You can still make it through this project, but it may feel a bit more difficult.

Don't give up! The more you struggle the more you learn üß†.

If you have no experience w/ React - [checkout this intro series](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) before you get started with this section or at least check out the intro docs [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html). Or don't do anything special, just hop in. Whatever works for you :). You'll be an absolute React Wizard after this project if you aren't already üßô‚Äç‚ôÇ!

### üë©‚Äçüíª Get the code

Start by heading over [here](https://github.com/buildspace/terra-starter) where you find the starter repo code. From here you're going to want to make sure you press the "Fork" button at the top right of the page:

Sweet! When you fork this repo, you are actually creating an identical copy of it that lives under your Github profile. So now you have your own version of this code that you can edit to your hearts content.

The final step here is to actually get your newly forked repo on your local machine. Click the "Code" button and copy that link!

Head to your terminal and cd into whatever directory your project will live in. I recommend putting it in the `clicker-portal` folder.

```
# Desktop/Learn-Terra/clicker-portal
git clone YOUR_FORKED_LINK
cd terra-starter
```

That's it! From there go ahead and run:
```
yarn install
```

This may error if you don't have Yarn installed, which you can do with 
```
npm install --global yarn
```

Now you can run the web app locally with:
```
yarn start
```

This should open up the app in your browser on localhost:3000. Your app is empty right now, just how we want it. This is going to be our blank canvas which we will spice up to our liking. For now, just update the page titles to whatever you want!

### üö® Progress Report
*Please do this else Raza will be sad :(*
