Here's the most important part of everything you've done this week. Getting off localhost. 

We're going to deploy our frontend to Vercel. Vercel is a hosting platform that makes it super easy to deploy your app. Best part? It's free!

First you'll need to push your project to Github. This should take about 5 minutes, if you're unsure about how to do this, just Google it!

Once you're done, head over to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and connect your Github account. It should automatically detect that this is a Next.js project and deployment should be straightforward. It'll spit out a link when the build finishes.

You are now off localhost! ðŸŽ‰
