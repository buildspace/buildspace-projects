Welcome to your final week of Solana Core! This week will be different from the past five. Our sole focus is to prepare our project to get it shipped by the end of the core.

Structurally, there will be no more formal lessons, instead we will give you tasks to accomplish on your own. Today’s task is to build out a lootbox solution. We will keep it on the simpler side for now. There will be written instructions in the next section. There will be some hints on how to approach it. Get creative, do what makes the most sense for your project.

We will also drop videos of the solution walkthroughs, but they’ll look a bit different from prior videos. In the past, we have coded along with you, this week, we will simply go over the code solution so that you can do more on your own. Remember, our solution is one potential option, by all means, please build what you would like.

We have covered a lot, you are ready for this, do the work independently, and then work through the walkthroughs if necessary, or if you’d like, attempt other paths to get the code working.
