Our contract is now ready to interact with! We're now going to build a React web app that will let anyone mint NFTs!

### ðŸ¤– Let's grab the starter code
Start by heading over to this [GitHub Link](https://github.com/buildspace/flow-nft-starter) where you can find the starter repo code. From here you are going to want to make sure you press the "Fork" button in the top right of the page

Sweet! When you fork this repo, you are actually creating an identical copy of it that lives under your Github profile. So now you have your own version of this code that you can edit to your heart's content :). This will also come in handy when we are ready to deploy our app to Vercel ðŸ¤˜.

The final step here is to actually get your newly forked repo on your local machine. Click the "Code" button and copy that link!

Finally, head to your terminal and cd into the `Learn-Flow` folder (mine is on the Desktop) that you made at the start of the project.

```
#Desktop/Learn-Flow
git clone YOUR_FORKED_LINK
```

Once the project repo is cloned into your directory use `cd` in your terminal to change your location to the root of the project and run `npm install`

```
#Desktop/Learn-Flow/
cd flow-nft-starter
npm install
```
This will install all the Javascript packages we'll need.

If you run 
```
npm run start
```

A local server will start and launch your app in the browser on http://localhost:3000/. Play around with the styling, and maybe use a different Gif!
