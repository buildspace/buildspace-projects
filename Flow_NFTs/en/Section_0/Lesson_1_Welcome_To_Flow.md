You've made it — welcome! My name is Raza and I’m going to be your installation wizard to the Flow blockchain at buildspace!

This project is for devs that want to get up and running with Flow - a blockchain built for the next generation of games, apps and the digital assets that power them. Hundreds of thousands of users already enjoy the experiences that companies like NBA, NFL and UFC have built on Flow.

All you really need to know going into this: some javascript and the basics of React.js. You'll pick up the rest along the way.

Few action items for you before moving on:

1. Connect your Discord in the project dashboard. All the good stuff is going to be happening in a secret category in the Discord that you'll only have access to once you connect your Discord.
2. Connect your Ethereum wallet in the project dashboard. We'll airdrop you an NFT once you finish this, and if you don't have a wallet connected we won't be able to airdrop it to you!! We're gonna be doing FLOATS on Flow, but, for now our whole system is built on Ethereum/Polygon so that's where we'll send the NFTs :).
3. Be sure to attend the live kick-off. If you miss it, no worries. It's not required to attend! The recording will be posted in Discord under #info-board.

### 🛠 The project

### 💎 Earning an NFT

When you reach the end of this project, you'll be able to earn an NFT.

**You'll only be eligible for the NFT if you finish it within 60 days of signing up.** So make sure you schedule time to finish, you got this!

**Once you finish the project, you'll get the NFT airdropped within 7 days**

Here's what it looks like:

You'll also get an exclusive FLOAT that you can show off!

**Note: It can take up to 7 days for your NFT to arrive (you'll get an email also!). If it's been more than 7 days please reach out to either Raza (TooManyBugs#3359) or Alec (alec#8853) on Discord!**

### 🤚 How to get help

When you have a question, hit up the proper channel for the project.

This project is broken up into 4 sections. You can see what section you're on by checking out the progress bar at the very top of the page in your buildspace dashboard. So, for example, if you're stuck on some part of Section 3, you'd hit up #section-3-help in the Discord. If you're part of multiple projects, be sure to ask your questions in the right project category!

### 🚨 Progress Report

Hey! Go ahead and say gm in #gm-only on Discord. This is very important. Extremely important. If you don't do this then all of humanity will collectively jump and disrupt the Earth's orbit causing it to collide with Venus.

BTW -- if you want to make a tweet telling the world that you're building an app with Flow today and tag @_buildspace, go for it!

We always say this, but 1) that tweet could inspire someone else to join web3 and 2) it supports us!
